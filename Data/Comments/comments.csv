世界中の人に認知されている日本でも象徴的な観光名所です。但し、ふざけた今今の名所じゃなくて数百年前から世界中に認知されている名所です。遺憾ながら、ここは写真撮影一つするのも大変です。東アジア系のインバウンドが撮影ポイントを早朝から夕方まで占領していて、その「蜜」状態は異常でもあります。迷惑な話です、観光災害が顕著な名所、世界遺産です。地元で７５年以上も生まれ育って来た小生には観光客とは災害を引き起こしている「敵」であり、心底、来てほしくない、交通機関は超満員、大きな荷物を人の迷惑も顧みずに公共交通機関に持ち込み、荷物料も払わない、大声で会話して騒ぐ、ゴミを平気で清掃された路上に投棄する、何よりも騒がしくて周辺の空気や雰囲気まで破壊しながら観光地を闊歩する、迷惑以外の何ものでもない。この場所が神聖な宗教施設で、ここが人生修行の場であること等、念頭にもない、何故、京都に来るのでしょうね？誰も来てくれと頼んでも居ないのに・・・。品の無い騒がしいだけの観光地に落ちぶれてしまった金閣寺、魅力は半減しますね。ご朱印所は大勢のインバウンドで長蛇の列、一体、この「印」は何のための印なのか？解って並んでいるのかな？スタンプラリーの印じゃないよ、どこにお参りして、その結果としての証明印だと解っているのかな？頼むから京都に来ないで、行政も何故、他府県や他国の人から入域税を取らないのかな？私が市長なら京都駅や主要道路の入口で証明書で確認の上、京都市民・府民でない人からは１人５０００円は徴収したいね、高くはないですよ、それほど地元は迷惑していると云うことです。,Tripadvisor
"This is undoubtedly a very beautiful and iconic temple, and it looks very serene and tranquil on the photos, but the crowds are insane. There was a massive queue to get in, a one way system in place, a huge amount of selfie lovers hogging the best views of the temple and the grounds weren't even that big. It's very well maintained and pretty but it's just too crowded to enjoy any time there.",Tripadvisor
Yes it can be crowded. And you don't actually get to enter the temple itself. But the grounds are beautiful and the building is stunning. Definitely include this one in your Kyoto itinerary.,Tripadvisor

What made our visit here really special was our tour guide from Hidden Japan Guided Tours. We met Chris at the train station and he offered us a full day guided tour of Mount Fuji. He lives there and has done for several years. What an amazing day we had. He took us to places that were of the beaten track. He was very informative but without talking all the time. Such a kind gentleman we couldn’t have found better and very reasonably priced. Would so use this tour company again.,Tripadvisor
"The temple was first built in 1397 contains bones from Shakyamuni,
particularly famous, structure known as the Golden Pavilion. It has a different architectura| style for each level. The lowest level, known as ""Hall of Purification of Passions"", the second level is known as the ""Cavern of the Sea of Buddha's Mercy"" and the"" uppermost level known as the ""Ultimate Peak"". The second and third levels are entirely covered in gold-leafed lacquer, and the roof is topped by a a mythical Chinese bird.
The building was lost to fire through arson in 1950, but rebuilt in 1955. In 1987 it was give a fresh coat of lacqer and the gold leaf was replaced. There is a garden, centered around the pond , is a beautiful sight. It can be viewed only from outside. The temple has been registered as a World Cultural Heritage Site in 1994. It is very popular among tourist. Visit it early to avoid big crowd.",Tripadvisor

"The Golden Temple is stunning - you do not go through the actual temple which is on a small island, but around the surrounding small lake.

Due to the time it takes to get here by public transport, this was one time that we travelled by taxi and we were glad that we did.",Tripadvisor
"We knew we wanted to climb Mt. Fuji, but for me, as a light sleeper, the thought of spending a night in a hut with 50+ other people seemed torturous. There's the hope that you'll be able to summit Fuji at sunrise, but the more research we did, the more we found that enjoying a spectacular sunrise as you summit Fuji is actually pretty rare. Therefore, we decided that we'd start first thing in the morning, hope to potentially enjoy a sunset instead, and head back down all in the same day. While considered one of the more difficult trails to the top of the mountain, it also seemed to be one of the quickest routes up and back. We saw enough reviews, YouTube videos, and blog posts that we decided we could do it.

We took the Subashiri bus from Gotemba Station, which left around 7 in the morning, purchasing our tickets as soon as the ticket office opened. We didn't know how many people would be there so we arrived about 25 minutes before they opened. There were about 10-12 people there already, so I stayed in line, and my husband walked down the block to the 7-11, where he purchased a couple of oxygen cans and hiking sticks. (This turned out to be a good deal - the hiking sticks were only 5¥ each instead of 15¥ at the 5th station!) Our biggest fear was that the last bus back to Gotemba left at 6:45, so we'd need to get up and back by then, otherwise we'd be stuck and either have to find a taxi or hope that we'd find space in one of the huts at the 5th station.

We arrived at the drop-off at the 5th station around 8 am. A few of the merchants were just setting up. We wanted the hiking sticks marked with the burned wood symbols, but the 5th station guy wasn't ready yet, so we began our hike. The Subashiri Trail is notable because near the bottom of the trail, you’re hiking through woods and over some boulder-like areas. You wander in and out of these shaded spaces and the rest of the time you’re out in the open, walking on volcanic ash and large gravel that feels like you’re perhaps walking on the moon. As you walk between the two kinds of landscapes, as well as walk UP, the weather can be quite changeable. We were here in mid August and within the span of 20 minutes and 20 meters, it could be hot, cold, drizzly, rainy or sunny. We were constantly un-layering and re-layering our jackets. This only increased as we ascended the mountain. Also, even though we were under cloud cover much of the time, and I constantly put on more sunscreen, I ended up completely sunburnt anyway. Wear as high a sunscreen as possible and reapply it at every station!

It’s recommended to bring water, but unless you can carry several bottles of water, or a water-bladder type of backpack, you’ll run out of water fairly quickly. Bring LOTS of 2 or 5￥coins! You’ll need them to purchase more drinks, the wood-burning symbols on your walking stick and to use the restrooms at some of the stations on the way up. With less oxygen as you head up, your body will feel a lack of water, so you’ll be sucking it down like there’s no tomorrow!

One thing that we found confounding is that there are marked signs along the trail letting you know how far the next station was. However, most often, the distance was marked in time rather than in meters, feet or miles. Since everyone goes at their own pace, the time between the 6th and 7th stations could be as little as 1/2 hour for one incredibly fit person and as long as an hour and 15 minutes for another. My husband and I are in our mid-50’s and while I’m very active and fit, he’s not nearly as in-shape as I am, so our paces were often at odds. Once we got to the 7th Station, his knees were bothering him a lot, and we didn’t know if we could get up and back in the same day at the pace we were going. We decided that I would continue on without him.

Although I’m not one of those people who dislikes doing things alone, it nevertheless was nice how other hikers formed a kind of camaraderie. There were some people that I sort of stayed near on the way up; sometimes I’d be a few meters ahead and sometimes they would be. There were people I briefly chatted with at the 7th and 8th stations that I then saw at the top and we all congratulated each other. There was girl from Slovakia hiking and traveling Japan by herself that I befriended. She took my photo at the top, and vice versa and we shared some celebratory pieces of chocolate for the effort. There were a few older Japanese men and women and a group of schoolchildren that I walked stretches with on the way up, that despite our language barrier, we encouraged each other as best we could.

Going up, I kept pushing myself thinking that I HAD to be back down to catch the bus. After the last station before the summit, it was very difficult. It was drizzly and I could tell that the lack of oxygen was a thing. I kept thinking of all the mountaineering documentaries and movies I’ve watched, and how people shuffle their feet to move ahead. While I wasn’t actually shuffling, my stride was measurably shorter and the times I stopped to rest became more frequent. I used my oxygen can once but it gave me the short boost I needed to get up that last 1/2 mile. At the top, there are several picnic tables to relax at, some small restaurants to grab some soup and a hot or cold drink and an abundance of others who are all friendly and relaxed now that the hard part is done. I only stayed for 20 minutes or so, but it was an accomplishment and worth sharing the time with others who’d done the same.

I thought that getting back down would be easy, but that was somewhat of a fantasy. While going up was hard, I don’t think anyone can prepare you for the depth of the ash/sand/gravel and how taxing it is physically to do over another couple of hours. Yes, you STILL HAVE A FEW HOURS to get back to the 5th station! Add to that the steep incline in places as well as the changeable weather, going down was actually my least favorite part! Despite being briefly sunny at the top, enough that I could get a photo, as I began my descent, it was raining heavily. With the wind, it was almost hitting my face horizontally and rather painful. In some places, the rocks were so slippery people all around, including myself fell down. I had on several layers and waterproof hiking pants, but it was utterly miserable. My shoes were constantly filling up with small pebbles and sand; it did no good to empty them because within seconds they were completely full again. I did empty them a couple times simply because I felt like the pebbles and sand, trapped between my socks and shoes, were causing blisters. Not seeing as many signs on the way down showing the distance back to the 5th station, I went as fast as I could safely do, but at one point, for at least a half an hour, I was all alone for as far as I could see in any direction. If I could’ve given up at that point, I would have, but there wasn’t an option to do that. As soon as I had a decent cell signal, I called my husband and based on my description, he said I was still about 35-45 minutes away. That was one of the longest several minutes of my life. I truly felt like I was stranded on the moon. Around that time, he saw me heading down and took a picture of me, a little speck, along with the 5 other people that finally came into my view. I almost cried when I met up with him at the small station near the bottom, but it was still another 45 minutes back to the bus pick-up. I'm very grateful that we purchased the commemorative hiking stick - it was SO helpful to have, especially helping keep my balance on the way down in the deep, wet ash.

All in all, it took me 9 hours and 2 minutes to go up and down. It took about 5 1/2 hours to go up, and the remainder was the descent. This also includes stops to acclimate to the elevation, drink some water, eat an energy bar, and take a potty break or two. I probably could have ascended faster if my husband had been able, but it’s much nicer to go with someone than without. Regardless, it was a very physical effort. I’m glad I did it, but there’s a Japanese saying that “if you climb Mt. Fuji once you’re wise, but if you climb a second time, you’re a fool.” I would completely agree with that statement. I’m glad I did it, but I don’t think I’d ever do it again.",Tripadvisor

"Alors oui, c’est un zone à touriste. Mais comment ne pas résister en découvrant ce lieu unique. Beaucoup de monde en effet vous suivez un circuit autour du temple devant des paysages magnifiques mais rien ne vous empêche de vous arrêtez quelques instants pour admirer, il faut savoir être patient.",Tripadvisor
"Preparing my trip to Japan I tried to find information about the option to complete the Subashiri trail in one day. There are several opinions that say that yes and some others that say that you have to be mad. So I want to share my experience giving as much data as possible.
Climbing date:
September 3rd 2019
Climbing team:
Me: 48, fit, runner
My wife: 48, not fit, but she usually walks between 4 and 8 kilometers 4 times a week
My son: 16, fit
Climbing technique:
After climbing several mountains we have discovered that the best way we have is to let my wife in her own pace and wait for her periodically.
She was not carrying any backpack, I was taking her meal, water and clothes in mine.
Going down, my son and I found out that pushing our heels against the places where there were little mountains of loose rocks and soil made easy to go down as they acted as a break. We saw some people with fear because they were slippering because they were using the toecap instead of the heel to go down. They were using much more energy than us to go down.
Climbing times:
We took the first bus from Gotemba and we arrived at the Subashiri 5th station at 8:35. We were there 10 minutes resting to avoid altitude sickness. After that my wife climbing times were:
9:45 6th station
10 minute rest
10:20 original 6th station
5 minute rest
11:15 7th station
10 minute rest
12:00 original 7th station
10 minute rest
12:30 8th station
10 minute rest
13:00 original 8th station
10 minute rest
13:20 8.5 station
5 minute rest
13:50 9th station
5 minute rest
14:15 summit

5 hours and 30 minutes to reach the summit
Our intention was to be there an hour but the weather was so bad that after eating and drinking we started our way down at 14:30.
15:30 7th station
17:05 5th station
2 hours and 35 minutes to come back to the 5th station

Evaluation:
If you are fit you will not have any issue with this hiking.
If you are not fit you can complete it as my wife did in around 8 hours what gives you 2 hours to stay at the summit or go slower and be able to take the last bus to Gotemba (some days there is a bus after 18:45 but that was not our case) but be aware that my wife suffered a lot, mainly when she was really tired and going down.
A french speaking couple 20 years younger than us but with bigger backpacks climbed up in parallel with us. So our times are not so difficult to achieve.

Recommendations:
The ones you can read in many posts:
- 2 liters of water per person. Our day was not very hot and we drank the 6 liters.
- Multi layer clothes. We went with a T-shirt until the 7 th station, the day was sunny with clouds, then a termic shirt until the 8.5 station, plus a polar jacket until the 9th and a light raincoat over all as it started to rain. At the summit we missed to have a pair of gloves.
- Don't take your reflex camera. It weighs a lot and it is usually cloudy.

If you like hiking this is a good experience and I liked Subashiri trail. The weather at the summit is impossible to forecast so your experience may vary a lot.",Tripadvisor
"My husband and I hiked Mt Fuji with Fuji Mountain Guides last weekend and I highly recommend their tour! We had 4 guides for the 30-40 people in our tour (strangers to us who grew to be friends, mostly military due to the holiday weekend). The guides were incredibly encouraging during the climb, organized, fun, and very experienced! This tour allows the freedom to climb at your own pace while being “monitored” by the guides to make sure you’re on the right trail and staying with the group. The hut was tight quarters especially for sleeping but food was great and it was clean considering it’s a hut on the side of a mountain. I do not have anything negative to share- we had a great experience and couldn’t have had a better experience! Thank you Fuji Mountain Guides!!!",Tripadvisor

At each station and at some points in between there are rest stops with restrooms 200 yen, snacks, and stamps for your stick 300 yen for one stamp, 500 yen for 2 stamps. It took us 8 hours to summit, 5 hours to descend. We caught in the dark, to a flashlight is needed. There was an overcast so there wasnt even moonlight to see by. It was pitch black!

"I hiked by myself at a slow pace as opposed to joining a tour group and had a great experience. Stayed overnight at Tomoekan original 8th Station Mountain Hut (with dinner and breakfast option), got up extremely early and started to hike towards the summit around 1am to ensure I got a front row seat at the summit to watch the sunrise which turned out to be super beautiful! It was VERY cold before sunrise so layering up is recommended! Also bring snacks and water if you can as they get more expensive as you get up the mountain! I also bought a headlamp and batteries before heading to Mount Fuji, but to my surprise they were available for sale at multiple mountain huts as well as the 5th station souvenir shops for almost the same price as I paid at Montbell! Getting a souvenir stick and having it branded at the mountain huts for a small fee makes for a nice souvenir :)
The way back down is somewhat dull and boring though and I felt it was tougher than the way up..",Tripadvisor
"This was the temple I was most excited to visit and it didn't disappoint. What a stunning building to look at!

"The hike up Fuji is definitely not for the faint hearted, some form of training and fitness will be needed for a potential trip to the summit.

We chose to hike up via Subashiri 5th Station trail, which is approximately a 40min direct bus ride from Gotemba Station. The hike on mix terrains took us 5hrs to 8th Station — we wound up at around 2100hrs at the Fujisan Hotel.

If you intend to catch the sunrise at the summit, most hikers set off around 2 - 2.30am for the upward hike, which should take an average of 1.5hrs for a relatively fit person. Otherwise, we understand that the sunrise can also be viewed from most mountain huts.

Mountain huts are basic rest areas — shared toilets, sleeping bags stacked shoulder to shoulder on wooden platforms, communal dining room, and curry rice for dinner. Multiple guests’ activities throughout the night is a norm, and might be a concern for light sleepers. Advanced bookings for the hut is recommended — we booked ours via Fuji Mountain Hut for the Fujisan Hotel Mountain Hut.

Tips: Minimal lockers available at Gotemba Station, so make sure to plan ahead on baggage arrangements.

The grounds and gardens are nice, and the actual temple buildings are everything you'd expect.

I don't especially like the fact that they make you walk around the whole thing before you leave (I get why, but as someone with arthritis in my knee, I find the steps challenging), I also don't like the shops at the top...they take away from the experience, in my opinion.",Tripadvisor

Le Pavillon d'or mérite bien son nom. Il faut absolument y aller un jour où il fait soleil : il étincelle littéralement.
Nous y sommes allés en fin de journée au mois d'aout et l'affluence était très supportable.
Il est assez excentré donc son accès est un peu plus compliqué. Il y a cependant suffisamment de bus pour ne pas attendre longtemps au retour.",Tripadvisor
il padiglione è collocato nello stupendo contesto naturale di un giardino zen e lo spettacolo è di una bellezza indimenticabile. Perfino la pioggia e la tanta gente in visita non guastano l'esperienza (ma è uno di quei siti per i quali vale la pena fare il sacrificio di svegliarsi molto presto e andare prima dell'assalto dei turisti ). Comunque stupendo,Tripadvisor

"In een park in het Noord-oosten van Kyoto staat deze prachtige gouden tempel aan de oever van een meer. Deze tempel is verre weg het mooiste onderdeel van het park, maar misschien ook wel de mooiste tempel in Japan. Bij de juiste stand van de zon refleteerd de tempel prachtig in het water.",Tripadvisor
"This is a beautiful temple covered in gold. It is surrounded by water and beautiful landscaping, Although you cannot go into the temple, there are many photo opportunities to capture the scenery.",Tripadvisor
"You actually do not go in the shrine, just walk around the path - you’ll see everything in just 30 minutes. On a day with low wind and no precipitation there is a beautiful reflection in the pond.",Tripadvisor
"Shrines and temples are in abundance in Japan, especially Kyoto, but theres a reason this one is so well known. Following a one way path that's large enough to handle crowds, but small enough to still feel like a calm walk through a garden, is a difficult feeling to capture but it was done well. The building itself makes for some excellent photos with the surrounding plant life and pond. Cheap admission and easily accessible from different Kyoto city buses doesnt hurt either. Take your time, enjoy the wall through the garden, and visit the many food vendors at the end of the path.",Tripadvisor

"My wife walked from Daitoku-Ji temple to here and then to the Ryoanji Temple. The temples were about 20 minutes apart.

The Golden Pavillion and its surroundings were beautiful. The highlight is the view of the Pavillion and the pond. You cannot go in to the Pavillion, you just walk around it.

We spent about 30 minutes here and enjoyed it.",Tripadvisor

"One of the highlight event during my visit to Tokyo, our climb was via Yoshida trail (Subaru Line 5th station) which is the most popular and easiest one. But it was not an easy climb, do prepare yourself with some good form of training! Took 5 hours to reach our mountain hut (Gansomuro), and continue to conquer the summit at 1am. The sunrise from the summit was definitely worth every drop of our sweats, it was amazing and mind-blown. But do prepare more layers as it is very (very very) cold especially when is wind is blowing. Descending was much more difficult and strenuous. Do prepare yourself with a good pair of hiking boots, knee-guard, windbreaker and hiking sticks. It was tiring yet amazing experience",Tripadvisor
"Of course as one of the best known sites in Kyoto it was quite crowded. However, given the lake surrounding you can still get some amazing views and pictures. Quite impressive and worth a visit.",Tripadvisor
Many thanks to Mike and Moto for a 'once in a lifetime' 2-days on the mountain. They arranged everything from door to door so made it a perfect way for us to enjoy and focus on the climb (which is much harder than some of the reviews would have you believe - especially going downhill !!),Tripadvisor
Peccato per la giornata di visita che era estremamente piovosa ma il tempio davvero bellissimo . Interamente dorato fatto come tutta la costruzione in legno di Kyoto ad incastri e senza chiodi . Nonostante il clima pieno di gente,Tripadvisor
"We climbed and summitted Mount Fuji using Fuji Mountain Guides. I organised the trip from Hong Kong, interacting by email, about six months in advance. All very easy, all questions well answered. A couple of calls a few days before we were due to climb to reconfirm weather and kit insured that when we were picked up from our hotel in Tokyo we were ready to go. Our guides were Michael and Moto. Genuinely nice, positive guys. we climbed in late September, and have hiking experience, so it was a pleasure to be able to do the track without being over managed, but nonetheless with the sense that the guides know their business. First day, full rain, up to station five for an overnight sleep in the mountain hut. All cool, normal Mountain Hut sardine conditions. Won’t at first day, full rain, up to station five for an overnight sleep in the mountain hut. All cool, normal mountain hut sardine conditions. Woke at 4:10am to clear skies to summit at 7:30 am.

The descent to, through 3 km of gravelly Sandy conditions, was arguably the most challenging. A tumbling Boulder, loosened from high above, crashing down along our Trail livened things up on the way down but without any injuries.

Two thumbs up to Michael and Moto. And five stars to Fuji Mountain guides. Mount Fuji, bucket list, tick!",Tripadvisor
Absolutely breathtaking. The tour and grounds we the highlight of our trip. Pictures do not do this temple justice. Akiko provided us with so much information that we could have never had known unless we used her.,Tripadvisor

"Due to bad time management, we arrived late by taxi with only 10/15 mins before the site close 😱 I was very close to giving up visiting, but we were already in the taxi so... By the time we got our tickets it was literally 10 mins before closing time! But what started with a panic turned out to be worth it. As it was closing there were by far a lot less crowds. When the temple came into view I felt so happy I got to see it. The weather was lovely, we were able to navigate the entire route and stop to take pictures in between. It all seemed a bit rushed due to time, but no crowds to push through and we saw everything there was to offer being grateful to the kind staff allowing us to enter and respectfully aware of their closing time. Of course it would have been better to allow more time but we honestly did not miss anything significant as is was just a single winding route, so it was worth going despite it was for only 10/15 minutes 😅",Tripadvisor
"Busy!  Views are stunning.  Very sexy!  Go in the evening or check when the sun sets.  Worth going here and then exploring the area as well and possibly getting a bite to eat. I went via Oshiage Station. Informative as well, so your learning too about landmarks and not just looking.",Tripadvisor
"We booked in advance as we saw lots of reviews where folks could not get tickets, so we took a chance and booked - when booking online there is no exchange if the weather is poor too!
When we got there - and by the way it is easily visited by the new train line going directly to it too! The tickets you buy online have to be transferred at the automated ticket desk, then you can proceed in the elevator.
When you get to the top the views are right there in front of you - the leaflets are really useful so grab one before you go up in the elevator as it details some of the landmarks you will see as well.
The views were really nice, but as an avid 'up high' viewer that I have been to all over the world the overall experience of One World in New York was much better.
When you get out the lift there is no momentum build, and it opens and you step to the windows and thats it.
There are souvenir shops you can buy the usual items, and there is a bar that is expensive and not much seating - but that high up - totally worth a beer!
I think I would recommend people do it, but no need to go back and do it (we did only the first level deck and not the highest one so maybe that experience is different)
I would suggest looking up the time of sun rise and sun set if there is a particular time of day you want to visit - and allow about 30 mins to get up there to the viewing deck - just in case!
We were not on a time limit when we were up there - but i know that in busy periods they can time limit you - bear this in mind!",Tripadvisor
"Grimper à 350 m déjà plus haut que la tour Eiffel, puis 450 m, à chaque fois à 600 m/min c'est époustouflant. Les oreilles se bouchent sinon on ne s'en rendrait même pas compte. A 350 m on fait un tour et l'on se rend compte de l'immensité de la ville et on aperçoit le Fuji qui émerge des brumes. A 450 m le sol devient encore plus petit.

Il est temps de redescendre à 345 m pour quelques achats à la boutique puis à 340 m pour la photo au dessus du vide entourée des membres de mon groupe et tout ça le jour de mon anniversaire qui restera gravé. Je finirai par mettre en avant l'ensemble du personnel bienveillant, de
l'accueil, de la billetterie, des ascenseurs, des boutiques, des photos qui sont aux petits soins afin de garder le meilleur souvenir de la visite.

"We are a family of 4 and are children are 17 and 14, we went with Fuji Mountain Guides up to the summit and well worth the trip. We met the guides at a local subway station in Tokyo and were driven by coach to the 5th station with a pit stop along the way. At 5th station we were able to leave small items behind if needed or rent additional equipment. We had 4 guides for a group of 24, all mixed abilities and younger children of around 10, and seniors of late 50s. The first stage is quite hard and long, each stage is shorter, but harder the higher you go. The guides were great breaking into packs depending on ability, we had frequent rest stops at each hut on the way, it was needed, this trip is more than a hard walk!! when we finally reached the 8th station at 3400m we were tired. Food was basic and so was the accommodation - dont expect any creature comforts. You pay for the tolets all the way up at around 200Y. We slept (if you can call it that) and left around 2.45am to walk to the summit. The guides took the longer but less steep route - its also a lot quieter. The sunrise was fab - well worth the effort even the kids enjoyed it! Some people went with a guide around the crater if they wanted to. The walk back is hard, the children found it easier but my wife struggled. Its a lot quicker on the way down! We also went a different route and you go down on loose gravel, so its hard on the thighs! There are fewer huts to stop at on the way down. Once meeting back at station 5 we then embarked on the coach and were able to be dropped at Gotenba station or you can head back to Tokyo. Well worth the effort, fabulous and knowledgeable guides who speak English and Japanese - well worth paying for as they take the stress out of the trip - we were lucky with the weather but they were well prepared if the weather were to turn. A must if your up for it!",Tripadvisor

We visited here last December 2019. We toured my mother in law with the kids. They enjoyed the view. You can see the city lights at night. It’s a little bit crowded that time. But we enjoyed it.,Tripadvisor
"Due to flight availability, I found myself with a Saturday in Tokyo in August 2019. I started investigating if it was possible to climb Mt Fuji in 1 day. Most searches will turn up tons of options to climb over night in order to be at the summit when the sun rises. I’m sure that’s magical, but there are several aspects of that did not appeal to me. Anyway, it is possible but it is difficult! Here’s how I did it (there may be other ways, but they’re hard to find).

I chose the Fujinomiya route because the starting point is the highest of all the paths. However, it is also the steepest. For reference, I’m in fairly decent cardiovascular shape as I run ~4 mi everyday.

06:33 Kodama Shinkansen from Tokyo station to Mishima station.

This part was tricky. Took the South exit out of the station, found the Fujikyu bus ticket booth and purchased a round trip ticket to Fujinomiya 5th station (Route B). It was tricky because there were only 10 minutes from the time the train arrived and when the bus left (07:40). Not many signs in English. This is a local bus, but almost everyone was in climbing gear. It’s a 2 hour ride and you’re not guaranteed a seat (I sat on the floor). You can find the bus schedule online, but you can’t advance purchase the tickets.

09:45. Arrived at Fujinomiya 5th station. Lathered up with sunblock (very high UV exposure!). I packed 2.5 liters of water, 5 Kind bars, and some Clif Blocks. 1000 Yen donation is expected before starting.

The path up the mountain was a combination of small loose volcanic rock and large rocks that serve as steps. I could not go as fast as I wanted to because of the crowds, but the occasional break was welcome. I stopped at each of the stations for ~5 min to drink water, eat something, and do some box breathing techniques to make sure I was getting enough oxygen.

13:15 arrived at the summit. Spent around 30 minutes there. Mailed 3 postcards which never arrived, applied more sunblock, and headed back down.

It was faster on the way down, but much sketchier. I would’ve fallen 3 times if I wasn’t hanging on to the rope hand rail. The loose rocks are unpredictable.

16:00 back to the 5th station. Quads were fried. Bought some more water and food at the shop.

17:05 bus back to Mishima. Got a seat this time, less crowded.

Grabbed the next Shinkansen and was back in Tokyo by 20:30.

It was an amazing day, but I wouldn’t recommend this if you’re not in good shape. There were all types of people on the mountain from young kids to octogenarians... they were all smartly taking their time. Saw plenty of people who either had altitude sickness or exhaustion. Personally, it felt like a really tough workout, but I never felt sick. If you’re into stats... My watch tracked 312 flight of stairs, 30700 steps! Finally, I recommend hiking shoes, the tread on my running shoes was torn up.",Tripadvisor

"Too much queuing! And not well laid out - i.e. do the first floor, then the higher floor and then back down to the glass floor level and then out…
Queuing for anything and everything and arguably (and we had great weather) the view is just too good! You’re so high up and with the way Tokyo is, everything appears so small (and even more so at the next level up).
Not particularly cheap, considering the entrance fees to most other attractions. There are much better (and cheaper) views available (Tokyo City View (the best) and The Government Metropolitan Building (free))…",Tripadvisor

There was still many things to do so we ate at a restaurant, shop at stores and saw the best kimono exhibit ever. Just as we about to leave the Mt. Fuji area, the clouds disappeared enough so we could see all of Mount Fuji including the top. The trip and wait was definitely worth it.",Tripadvisor
"I am so so glad I booked tickets for my partner and I a couple days beforehand. The line for people with pre booked tickets took around five minutes. The line for people yet to buy tickets looked to be over half an hour wait time.
Views were good. But just simply too many people made it quite annoying.",Tripadvisor
The tallest structure in Japan is the Tokyo Skytree. Admission to the top floor observation deck is approximately $15 US. The 360 degree views of Tokyo are nothing less than spectacular. Mount Fuji can also be seen on a clear day. The adjacent aquarium is also a very worthy attraction that should not be missed.,Tripadvisor

"I was slow but made it to the summit of 12,388 ft. Bring breathable rain gear. I got caught in the thunderstorm when I was at the tail end of my descent. Recommended to allot 6 hours for ascent and 4 hours for descent. When you reach the summit, go around the crater. Descent path is different from ascent and is mostly steep, loose gravel - tall hiking shoes and long pants help both ways. I took the train from Tokyo starting around midnight and stared the hike by 9 am. Note: Train stations closes between 2-4 am. I ended up hanging around outside the train station; luckily the police station was across the street so they watched over me. Also note the last time the shuttle bus will run to catch your train back as well as what time the last local train will depart. Taxis are outrageously priced. If you purchase a souvenir short hiking stick to get stamped at each station, you will not have enough space so recommend only getting it from actual, 5, 6, 7, 8, and summit stations. The 9th station was all torn apart. Hydrate well before the hike and possibly taking some Dramamine for the windy shuttle bus ride. Lots of people seem to get altitude sickness and have to turn around. Bring cold weather gear; it went from 90* at the bottom to about 40* at the top. Water is available for purchase at the stations but expensive. Make sure you have water before you start the descent as water access will be limited compared to ascent. Happy trails!",Tripadvisor
"We went to the observatory decks on both the 350 m & 450 m levels of the Tokyo Skytree. The prices were reasonable for tickets, and you got excellent views of Tokyo and the surrounding areas. The tower is located right where many shops & restaurants are located. Which adds to the convenience for tourists visiting the Skytree.",Tripadvisor
The lift to the levels were well organized . The view from the 450m level was quite vast but unfortunately the weather limited the distance of sight. On the 350m level they have a glass floor area which was really spectacular. Had a bar and gift shops. Well worth doing when in Tokyo.,Tripadvisor
"I went to Skytree at 10am on a Monday morning and it was so uncomfortably overcrowded. They sell way too many tickets and majority of the time is spent queuing either for the escalator, elevator or to get a physical ticket. I had a prebooked ticket and you have to queue up and present this to staff but then you have to queue up again at a machine and get a paper ticket. This is such a waste of time. I spent around 75mins in total at Skytree but 75% of this was spent waiting in queues.

The space up in the observatory (I went to both levels) is relatively small and every available window spot was taken so you are waiting for a few minutes to get a glimpse of the view or a photo.

I had previously done Shibuya Sky at dusk and found it way more enjoyable. Even though it was busy (sold out) it wasnt uncomfortable.",Tripadvisor

"We went there as a family in golden week for a day trip out of tokyo. The issue was since it was golden week the bus trip took longer than expected and while returning also longer than expected.

When we reached the path to mount Fuji trolley was clearly marked and we just followed however since we had to catch return bus and the queue was huge, so we missed our trolley also. The views however were clear skies and amazing. The Fuji peak looked so mesimerizing.

There was also a boating option available in lake which you can enjoy and there are small cafes and shops all around.",Tripadvisor
"🚫 Avoid this place at all costs! Not only is it a waste of your precious time 😞💔, but it's also an unnecessary drain on your hard-earned money 💸💸. If you're considering visiting the 450m, don't even bother. The view is exactly the same as the 350m 🏙️😑, so you'd only be paying and waiting in line for an extra 20 minutes without any added value.

Even if you have an advance ticket, you'll still have to spend a total of 40 minutes just to reach the 350m level, and then another 20 minutes to go up to 450m 😩. Frankly, there are far better ways to spend your time and money than on this disappointing experience.

Paying 150 RMB/3400 JPY/21 USD for adults is just not worth it 💸🙅‍♂️. Save yourself the trouble and consider skipping the 450m entirely. If you must go, stick to the 350m for a similar view without the unnecessary hassle and expense. Your time and money are better spent elsewhere! 🏞️💰 (and it’s 20 more mins to get down)",Tripadvisor
Tokyo skytree is a definite must see. Everything in Japan is an advance tickets with reservation so thanks to Tripadvisor we were able to go.,Tripadvisor
"In my opinion it’s better to by postcards or videos with the -truly amazing- view. Going there you are squeezed in a crowd of thousands of people, wait for 20 minutes in the first queue to go up, another 15 to go to the to level, where you are trying to get a place at one of the windows. It’s awfully loud, music and commercials everywhere, and the whole place even in the top level is packed with anime and Pixar and Disney ads, why on a place like this? Trying to escape this nightmare you wait in another 2 queues to go down, and in the end you have to find your way to the station through a shopping mall, where you can buy hello kitty, Pokémon and overpriced plastic souvenirs. Sad experience, what a pity!",Tripadvisor
"when i went, they're currently in the midst of their collab with Tokyo Disney. more ppl up there were interested in the disney posters and photo points compared to the actual thing

these kinds of places don't usually have a lot of space in general, but when we arrived, people were sitting all over the floor overlooking the areas that you can see the entire city. it was hard to walk and only after a while did the staff come to ask them to stand up and give us more space

going up to 450m wasn't exactly necessary for me. the scenary doesn't get much different up there and it just had too many people clogging up the tiny space. within a short while we went back down because it got a little uncomfortable

the place is good at what it's meant to do: see the city. just the people clogging up the areas might turn the experience to be a little more claustrophobic than preferred",Tripadvisor

"Mostly people share positive experience but I would like to tell about the situation which shocked me and my relatives and which I can't imagine in other countries. We climbed Mt Fuji a day ago. We were pushed to leave our car at the parking and reached the Station 5 by a shuttle bus (parking fee 1000yen, bus ticket 1000 yen). The weather was fine when we started climbing. People were allowed to go further. At station 6 Japanese in uniform warned that taifun was coming but tourists were allowed to go further. After reaching one of stations 7 the rain begined. And here, the most important, tourists were not allowed to enter inside the Station to protect from the rain. We continued going. At the Station 9 (last before the summit) people were not allowed any more go further. It was very raining and cold. Most of tourists were staying outside, without any cover. To enter inside the Station, without reservation, were not allowed. The room was not full. And, the owner of the Station (with ambitions of an owner of the mountain) behaved aggressively, shouted and touched me when I insisted to enter inside (I was ready to pay). It was an extreme hostility from the Japanese. So, when you go to the Fuji, remember that you will not be able to find a shelter if the weather becomes bad, you will not be allowed to enter inside even to dreank a cup of bad coffee. There are no at all covers to hide while raining. Despite Japanese officials considered taifun dangerous and new that it was coming they brought tourists to the Mountain, allowed to climbed, didn't offered any protection. And even more demonstrated high level of hostility towards foreigners. It was the worst touristic experience I ever had. And I'm afraid to think that me, my teenage daughter and my relatives observed the real essence of the Japanese nature.",Tripadvisor

Ein Hubschrauber Landeplatz mit künstlichem Rasen darf auch betreten werden. Anfang März waren weniger Touris wir wir hier. Der perfekte Start auf unserer Japan Rundreise.",Tripadvisor

"We accidentally booked & paids for the incorrect date for this tour before we arrived in Toyko. We originally entered the date we wanted but it somehow defaulted to the month we were currently in. Because we had arranged a number of activities this was overlooked. We only realised our mistake when we arrived in Toyko. JTB Global were not interested in our problem, refusing to undertake a refund or re-schedule the tour in the 10 days we were in Japan. Surely they would have had two spaces on some other tour to assist us but the only response was we were a ""no show"" so nothing could be done!!! This is poor business practice because we now will tell all our traveling friends not to use this company",Tripadvisor
"Palazzo d'oro una delle più belle attrazioni di Kioto! Peccato ho fatto una visita troppo veloce vale la pena stare un paio d'ore anche se molto piccolo. Vale la pena la visita, leggete la storia!",Tripadvisor

"We navigated the trains and buses to get here at 8:30am. There were about 50 of us waiting to get in at 9am when it opens.
By 9am there were 200-300 people at the gate.
A self guided tour is fine and you could be done in an hour. Plenty of drink and food stations there.
An amazing sight to see that you need to get to early to beat the crowds and heat",Tripadvisor
"This is an easy trail. You do not need to be super fit, just do not rush and take your time.

My suggestions to those who will come,
- To prevent AMS, take Acetazolamide before doing this
- You need hiking shoes and trekking poles
- Also bring your slippers
- Bring enough water, at least 2 L/person
- Do not forget sunscreen lotion
- Sometimes it rains, prepare a lightweight raincoat.
- Snacks are good, power bar/gel is not necessary
- Better to spend the night at the Summit
- Book an Onsen session afterward to reward your effort.",Tripadvisor
"This temple is worth seeing because it’s different from all the other temples, with the gold. There’s a path that goes around the temple and the area.",Tripadvisor
"From the first email to the day I received my Mt. Fuji Certificate of Summit, Fuji Mountain Guides has been a world class, professional, well organized and genuinely kind operation. I signed up for the 2 day Mt. Fuji Climb August 20. For the entire climb, the 4-5 guides were attentive, personable - you felt like you were climbing with a friend - always making safety a priority, coordinating and dividing among each other to support the different climbers' speeds and always counting the number of participants to make sure we were all account for. There were several climbers who didn't have any family or friends climbing with them but the guides make sure that everyone felt included and had a great time. The guides made everything easy for us, we had plenty of time to stop for food, bathroom breaks, water, the overnight hut was the best that can be found in such a remote area. What also stood out was the respect and support the guides had for one another, true team work to provide an amazing experience to us climbers. All guides spoke fluent English. It's clear that what they do for a living is their passion and it showed in their empathy, patience and how much fun they had with us. The Guides also took us on trails where we didn't have to wait in the long lines for the summit. Sunset and sunrise on Mt Fuji, WOW! I would do this tour again in a heartbeat. Thank you so much to the guides of August 20 overnight 2 day tour, you all are outstanding!",Tripadvisor
"Der Pavillon ist ein Besuch wert, da er wirklich etwas besonderes ist! Bei uns war die Anlage auch nicht überfüllt. Am besten mit dem City Bus anreisen.",Tripadvisor
"Ce temple est petit, excentré, son jardin n'est pas extraordinaire, il est très fréquenté. Pourquoi cinq étoiles alors ? Parce qu'il fait toujours de l'effet même quand on le voit pour la troisième fois comme mois ou pour la première fois comme mes enfants qui ont adoré. Le voir sous le soleil renforce son effet.",Tripadvisor
"Aus der Innenstadt Kyotos fährt man ca. 45 Minuten City-Bus, um zum Pavillon zu kommen. Angekommen erreicht man einen riesigen Reise-Busbahnhof in dem die Besucher in Massen angekarrt werden.
Nach den Kassen gibt es nur einen einzigen Weg. Obwohl das Gelände größer ist, darf nur dieser Weg verfolgt werden und du darfst nicht umdrehen. Der Weg geht über mehrere Treppen. Wir halfen einer Oma mit Kinderwagen, der diese Begebenheit nicht gesagt wurde.
Der goldene Pavillon ist das Herzstück des Parks. Er ist kleiner als gedacht. Man darf keine Gebäude betreten. Es gibt keine Bank oder Schattenplätze. Nach 10 Minuten wurde man bereits durch den Park geschoben und muss die 45 minütige Rückreise antreten, da es kaum Aufenthaltsmöglichkeiten gibt.",Tripadvisor
It takes about 2 hours to get here from Tokyo and depending on whether you think the distance is worth it to go see the mountain. Stopped at the 5th station which is where every tourist goes to to view the mountain. Sometimes it gets foggy and you might not be able to see it at all. But we found it not so spectacular.,Tripadvisor

The Golden Pavilion has different architectural styles on each level: The lowest level is Shinden style and is known as the Hall of Purification of Passions, the second level is Samurai style and is known as the Cavern of the Sea of Buddha's Mercy, while the uppermost level is in the Zen style, and is known as the Ultimate Peak.",Tripadvisor
"I climbed Mt. Fuji using the Yoshida Trail Route from 5th station in early August. I participated in guided climbing tour. The view from the summit of Mt. Fuji was amazing!

But falling stones are reported frequently at Mt. Fuji, and besides, a falling stones accident occurred near the summit of Mt. Fuji on August 26 and killed a young woman from Russia. I also witnessed falling stones while climbing. If you plan to climb Mt. Fuji, be careful it to protect yourself.

There is a rule among Japanese climbers that if they notice falling stones they immediately shout “raaaaaku!!” or “laaaaaku!!”. They shout like that because falling stones are called “落石 rakuseki” in Japanese. So if you hear “raaaaaku!!” or notice unusual things by yourself on the trail, squatted down along the mountainside wall immediately to let falling stones go past.

If you find signs that says “落石” or “落石注意”, it means that you need to careful it especially around there. There are some white tunnels, which are shelter to avoid falling stones, on trail course. You need to walk through the tunnels to pass safely.

If you are a relatively beginner, I recommend that you join guided climbing tour.

Mt. Fuji climbing will give you a wonderful experience. I hope you’re having fun on your trip!",Tripadvisor

"Fujiyama is the highest point of Japan, at 3,776 metres above sea level. It took me 9 hours climb and 3 hours down, back to the Fifth station of Fuji-Subaru Line. The reason of delay was due too many climbers on that night (18 August 2019) and the path after 8th station is quite small. I did not climb all the four peaks of Fuji. just took picture and have a break. Then, descend to the starting point. Quite challenging though.",Tripadvisor
"We just did the one ticket to the 350m height. Its plenty to see! The 450 requires another long wait for the elevator and is almost double the price. Great facility. Elevator was awesome. Clean windows, nice restrooms and views for miles!",Tripadvisor
Worth the effort. Buy your pass first online and exchange on site. Queue looks horrendous but moves very quickly when your hour slot arrives. Great views and efficiently operated.,Tripadvisor
Der Skytree ist 634 m hoch und der drittgrößte frei stehende Turm der Welt. Mit den Aufzug geht es in wenigen Sekunden nach oben. Bei Kauf der Tickets bekommt man eine Uhrzeit zu der man auf die Plattform gelassen wird. Alles funktioniert reibungslos. Der Ausblick auf die Skyline Tokios ist atemberaubend. Einige Sitzgelegenheiten stehen zur Verfügung. Eine Kunstrasenfläche mit Hubschrauber Landeplatz darf betreten werden und stellt den höchsten Rundum- Aussichtspunkt dar. Als Japan-Reisender ist diese Besichtigung ein Muss. Mitte März waren weniger Touris wie wir hier.,Tripadvisor
"The Skytree is easily accessible, with direct entry from the Oshiage (Skytree) station. We booked for the 10am entry and there was already a queue of about 30 people when we arrived at 9.45am. Tickets are 'exchanged' by scanning the QR code on the voucher at the kiosk. There are 4 lifts going up to 350m deck so queue moved quite quickly. It was unfortunate that the weather was overcast on the day of our visit but nonetheless, the view was fantastic. We took another lift up to 450m for an even better view. We spent about an hour there (+ another 30 mins at the Skytree shop). Overall a great place to visit with the kids.",Tripadvisor
"Having a ticket purchased online was convenient as we did not have to wait in line. However, we waited longer for the elevators, as there are only 2 operating units that could only accommodate a small number of people. Our schedule was supposedly in time for the sunset, but due to the long waiting time, it was already dark when we got up.",Tripadvisor

"We were lucky enough to go on a day with short lines. I do agree that the 450 view is not all that but might as well see it all since you’re there. That was our logic.
The view is beautiful and the building is basically a shopping mall. Overall, a very cool experience.",Tripadvisor
"There are two different types of admission tickets. We chose the one that takes us to the level of 350 m from the ground. It cost 2100 yen. The view was good, but I am not sure if it’s worth. There are many more better attractions in Japan. It might be better to use the money for something else. It looks like you can buy a ticket at 400 yen cheaper with early purchase (purchased one day before your visit) at a Seven Eleven shop.",Tripadvisor
"2-day tour from 2,000 m to the hut on 3,400m, overnight stay and ascent to the peak before dawn.
Thank you, dear guides, for a memorable experience! Fuji Mountain Guides can be highly recommended! Perfect to good English skills and all speak Japanese.
They advised us well with regards to the tour, equipment, food, etc. We felt well looked after and cared for, and always safe.
Our 3 guides were communicative with a good sense of humor.
The tour itself is technically easy, but tough - good fitness is recommended.
Be prepared for weather changes; you can get very hot and very wet!
There are not many shelters and the staff in the huts can be a bit abrasive. Our accommodation for the night was ok, but you should expect something really basic. No opportunity to dry your clothes- so ensure you bring dry gear and pack it in a waterproof bag in the rucksack.
Overall a great experience, thank you guys!

"Perfect outing for New Years Day in Tokyo, where most of the city is closed this area is bustling and you get great views of the city. Only complaint is how crowded it is. Tons of people. Compared to Shibuya Scramble observatory on Christmas Day, it was a lot busier and harder to enjoy because of the crowds. But there's a nice outdoor concert, lots of food options to choose from, and well organized.",Tripadvisor

"Skytree is very impressive when looked at from below, and obviously is visible from far away across Tokyo.
While the views from the 350m floor were very interesting, it was not worth the extra money and time to go up to 450m. Views changed very little, perhaps noticeable if you looked hard.
However, I don’t recommend visiting Skytree at all on a busy day. On a weekend, the main activity was waiting. Managed to avoid queuing for a ticket by buying beforehand, but still had to queue for the lift/elevator up, and then almost an hour wait to go to the 450m floor and the same to come back down, which was very tiring.",Tripadvisor
"We went at what Google recommended was a quiet time (7pm) on a friday having prebooked our tickets.

The lines of people waiting for entry are just overwhelming, so much so that you feel so tightly packed , it won't take much to trigger a crush. The Japanese people are so disciplined, polite and tolerant and don't jump ques like tourists from abroad. It was this attribute more than any vista that we admired most. It took an hour to get in and another 45 minutes to get out, which felt like a relief.",Tripadvisor

"A one day coach trip with local pick up from nearby hotel. Bus & driver were great, Tour leader was friendly helpful & knowledgeable. Destinations of Mt Fuji, Hakone, the ferry ride plus the cable car ride were all good. Lunch on the other hand was was awful it required a long walk thru an amusement park with facial id scan to get in only to be presented with a meal featuring tempura that was COLD because it had all been served before we even arrived. After a long drive back to Tokyo we were dropped off in the city centre miles away from our hotel & had to make our own way back at 8pm at night.
It would have been a much more enjoyable day if the lunch was better & the drop off was at the same place we were picked up.",Tripadvisor
"I'll say I'm glad I did it. Been to Japan many times before and to celebrate my husband's 40th bday, we decided to finally hike Mt Fuji. A couple of tips, book your express bus tickets early to 5th station, we thought we could wing it but we were wrong, we ended taking two trains and a bus to get to 5th station because the bus was sold out, took longer and it was more expensive. Don't stay at the huts if you can, they are disgusting. They're not dirty, the facilities are actually as clean as it can be, it being on a mountain. But I def don't think they wash the sheets or pillows for an entire season given how scarce water is (they wouldn't give you water to brush your teeth or wash your face) and this is like $80 a night per person. And you're sleeping like sardines next to people, there's not even space to laid flat and I'm not big (120lb), I had other men sleeping so close to me it was uncomfortable. And everyone's snoring. It's NOT cheap and you're only sleeping a couple of hours. They wouldn't even give me a wet wipe to wipe my hands/face. It was terrible. So try to avoid the huts if you can. But this is NOT the most beautiful hike at all. I've done better hikes in US, China, New Zealand, and Australia before and this is disappointing. Going up is fine, but coming back down is PAINFUL, just imagine walking on tiny rolling rocks for 4 hours, it killed our feet and knees going down, and there's no scenery/view, it's freaking BORING! You get a better view of Mt Fuji from Lake Kawaguchi.",Tripadvisor
"During our trip to Kyoto, we were finally able to see the famous Kinkakuji. One of the famous iconic temples in Japan, I've seen it in the pictures throughout my life. So many place to visit in Kyoto in such short time, I wasn't sure, if we were able to squeeze this spot in. Fortunately, our hotel let us check in early and quickly, we had a chance. Thank you, Campton Kiyomizu! We took a bus 206 Kita-Oji from Kiyomizu Michi heading North. Then change to 204 at Kita-Oji terminal. We used ICOCA IC card. We get off at Kinkakuji Michi which is just a short walk away from Kinkakuji. As many reviewers pointed out, only thing to do is to admire the temple and take pictures as you walk around the pond. Having not much else to do actually worked to our advantage to make this stop a quick one. The temple was so shiny in the late afternoon sun. It was crowded for sure, but most of the tourists were respectful not to ruin others' photos by giving some spaces. At the end, we ended up with many great pictures, just like the ones in the magazines and text books. Over all, I highly recommend stopping by to see the temple with your own eyes.",Tripadvisor

"Since travelling to Japan in my teenage years and seeing Mt Fuji from our bullet train I have had a fascination with it. On my next trip it was in the clouds! On my third trip I did a day tour to 5th station and several other spots which were meant to offer you extensive views but it was again in the clouds. This time I was determined to spend a few days in the area so that I gave myself every opportunity to see it in its full glory. As it was March the snow was too far down the mountain so fifth station was closed. Our Airbnb in Lake Kawaguchi had magnificent views. We sighted the mountain from the train and then travelled by bus to our destination. Clear skies and the most incredible views. It was quite chilly at Lake Kawaguchi but well worth the effort. We hopped on a bus that took us to several spots where you could pay for a day pass and jump on and off as often as you like. Got so many amazing photos, my friends who were with us were blessed as they didn’t realise how elusive it can be. Mt Fuji is very dear to me due to my heritage (my grandma is Japanese and my grandpa met her after the war) and I see it as the symbol of Japan and one to be treasured. I have not finished yet I aim to get back and do the climb! Also when travelling on the train ask for the side with views, I didn’t have to ask when booking all my train travel they just automatically put us on the best side every time to experience the best views.",Tripadvisor

"Mt Fuji is probably the most iconic symbol of Japan, most people associate Japan with this snow capped mountain. You can view this mountain from many places on a clear day if you are lucky without going to Mt Fuji itself. One cheap and easy place to view it if you use the JR pass is from Shin Fuji station and outside the station. We did exactly that and got some pretty good photos of Mt Fuji before clouds blocked our view. Luck was certainly on our side.",Tripadvisor
"In September, I joined about 20 other folks and hiked to the summit with Fuji Mountain Guides. This company does it right. Their guides are very knowledgeable and keep a a careful eye on everyone to be sure you are safe. The hike turned out to be much tougher than I had imagined. It is less than 5 miles from the 5th station to the summit but you gain more that 5000 feet in elevation over that short distance. So the trail is very steep and unrelenting. We stopped for the night at a small hut at about 10000 feet and then went to the summit the next morning. One of the disappointments was finding that there are actually roads that heavy equipment use to drive all the way to the summit. The top of the mountain is an unattractive volcanic crater. The day we got to the summit, we were above a cloud layer so the views were very limited. I am glad I did this hike, and I did feel a big sense of accomplishment, but it was not the great emotional experience I was hoping for. In Japan there is a saying that ""a person who has not climbed Mt. Fuji once is a fool, but one who has climbed it more than once is even more of a fool"". I can now fully appreciate this statement.",Tripadvisor
Mount Fuji in the spring with snow on the cap is amazing and worth a stop. Take a coach tour up and the bullet train down,Tripadvisor
I did an epic 1 day trip by bus independently from Shinjuku bus station.I followed the itinerary from a website called trulytokyo.com.From buying bus tickets to how to navigate your way through Shinjuku train station that has 200 exits to the bus station were very accurate.Arriving at Mt Fuji i continued to follow the itinerary but found the landmarks and the bus stops did not correspond. I had a fabulous day but just had to cross reference all the bus stops to get off at the right landmarks.It was a beautiful clear sunny day and the gorgeous mountain was in view for the 7hrs that i was there for.What a memorable day,Tripadvisor
"Dear Hikers,

I just want to give you a nice hike recommendation in case you visit mount Fuji in times, where the 5th station is closed. We went in February and were quite disappointed that we were not allowed to go to the 5th station by car. Security persons were even blocking us to hike the road further up (for safety reasons of course, as always in japan).
We then drove down to the third station and from there took a hiking trail all the way up to 5th station. That was an awesome experience, since we've had an amazing viewpoint only for us. The trail is well marked in the app maps.me and start a few meters up the road from the third station . It took us (usual fitness, but young) 2 hours each way. There was some snow, some ice, and one or two trees on the way, but in total it was defenitely doable =) I would have safed us some time when starting from 4th station, but it was not possible to escape the useless workers there.

I can highly recommend you taking this trail when you want to do a hike on Fuji where nobody else is in winter =)

Cheers",Tripadvisor

"Bought a to and fro ticket for a bus ride from Tokyo central to Mount Fuji. Used the local bus pass at Fuji to move around the area. The ride from Tokyo to Fuji gives a good glimpse of Tokyo city as well as the country side. Mt. Fuji is visible from most of the places in the town unless your view is obstructed by buildings or trees. I felt that the best view was from the Kawaguchiko Natural Living Center and I spent most of my time here (decided after having visited other places to catch a glimpse of the mountain top which was covered by clouds for a long time). The garden, flowers, and the lake add to the beauty. Of course, you may not be able to catch a glimpse of the entire mountain immediately; but the place provides a nice ambiance to spend time, with the mountain always in your sight.",Tripadvisor
"We visited Nara in second half of a day trip including Himeji from our base in Osaka. Got to Nara approx 12.30 and left 4.30. Walked around Nara park and fed the deer which is both hilarious and touching, assuming you like animals. They are so friendly, even if you dont have food. We got some great videos that I will watch over and over. If you have kids this is literally unmissable for them.
Close to the park is Kasuga shrine and Tadoji-ji temple, the latter housing the great Buddha. Highly recommend getting these in too. There is a 1000 year old tree on the grounds and you dont see those every day!
Nara and the deer will be one of my best memories from Japan.",Tripadvisor

"I was originally travelling at night from Kyoto to Tokyo but changed to a daytime train in the hope that I might catch a glimpse of the fabled Mt Fuji. I have stayed in Yokohama and not been lucky enough to get a clear view due to cloud.

When I booked my train seat the counter has a seat plan to show Mt Fuji view seats. I asked for a window seat and crossed my fingers. From Kyoto to Tokyo the seats are on the left and you are travelling on the left side track.

As we left Kyoto it was an overcast day and it had been trying to snow. I thought I might be unlucky again. As we left Kyoto there was a complete white out. So I got my book out. Not long after the snow cleared and so did the sky to a beautiful blue.
If its a clear day you see the Mountain for quite some time even travelling at speed. It just gets better and better. It was the glorious end to an amazing few days. Even my rubbish old phone got stunning photos.",Tripadvisor

Detto ciò, il tempio nel mezzo il solito tempio rovinato da turismo e da bancherelle, evitate quindi… Forse il museo c’è ma per quelli che ho visto in giappone lasciam perdere anche quelli…",Tripadvisor
"Going to the Nara Park was a fun family outing, despite the heat. The deer park was adorable and everyone loved feeding the ""bowing deer"" and than walking through the park, trying to find shade. We also visited the Inisuen Garden, which was largely shaded and quite beautiful. We rounded out our visit with a trip to the famous mochi-making establishment of Nakatanidou while passing the famous temples along the way. We also visited the gift shop in the Art Museum, which kept us cool for a bit and offered us some nice souvenirs. It was all very touristy, but sometimes that's what you're there for!",Tripadvisor

"訪問前に頭を悩ませたのが車をどこに停めて歩いていくかという問題。

訪問日当日の予想最高気温が３８度だったこともあり、なるべく暑くなる時間帯と歩くのは避けたいということで朝早く訪れたら多少は人手も少ないだろうと考え、9時頃に到着したところこれが大正解だった。

訪問前に駐車場情報を調べていると、基本、車での訪問は想定しておらず、周辺駐車場が乏しい場所であり、少し離れた大きな駐車場のある主要施設に車を停めて、そこから観光用
の「ぐるっとバス」を利用するパーク＆ライドを利用するよう推奨されていた。

そこで自分なりに探してみたところ、どうも公園からは徒歩数分の高畑町周辺に相当数の駐車場が用意されていることが分かった。

自分が停めたのは細い道から入っていく志賀直哉旧居跡のすぐ近くの５００円の所であったが、公園に向かう道沿いにもこじんまりとしたパーキングはちらほらあり、大通り沿いには高畑駐車場８００円が公園までのアクセスが一番良く100台くらい駐車できで良いと思えた。

こじんまりとした数台しか停められないような小さな駐車場も多数あって、車で訪れる人なら高畑町で探せば土日祝日に訪れたとしても停められないということはまずないと思う。

東大寺の駐車場が2,000円もするのに対してこちらが安いのは、結局公園の表玄関からアクセスするか裏玄関からアクセスするかの違いなだけで、鹿のみが目的で寺院に訪れる予定がない人は裏口の高畑町からアクセスしたほうが人込みも回避できるし、駐車料金も安くなるので一挙両得と思えた。

この公園の鹿だが、鹿せんべいをあげずに眺めている分には愛嬌もあって人にも慣れていて随分とかわいらしい。

しかし、餌を見たとたんにわんさか寄ってきて、服に嚙みついてきて、挙句の果てにはずっと餌をもらえるまで付きまとってくるので相当図々しい。

餌やりを予定している人は、①餌を買ったらすぐに餌を隠すこと、②餌の紙の包装を解くときもなるべく鹿には見られないようにすること、③他の人が餌やりをしていて鹿たちの注意がそれているときに鹿せんべいを買うようにすることの3点を心がけると楽しく鹿たちと接することができると思う。",Tripadvisor
"Since 1.300 years people pray here for happiness and prosperity. During the Heian period the imperial court prohibited hunting here and - according to the Japanese - this is the only place in the world where humans, nature and animals live together peacefully under the protection of the Kasuga deities.

When you walk among the deers and they approach you without any fear, you can really feel that this place is special.",Tripadvisor

"Nara park is a must visit destination if you are in Kyoto. The deers were just around and you get to experience to feed them first hand. You get to buy a set of cookies for 200 yen. Be prepared as if the cookies are in your hand, they can smell it and the deers will swarm around you and they bite if you are too slow.
So better wear jeans so keep you safe from their biting and don’t use your favorite shoes as there’s poop everywhere.",Tripadvisor

"We took a day trip to Nara from Kyoto. The journey to get here wasn't difficult. Most challenging part of the visit was the stormy rainy weather(thunderstorm). Mother nature did not cooperate and we didn't experience the spring atmosphere that was supposed to happen around cherry blossom season. To quickly summarize we visited the park for about 30minutes, visited a nearby museum(to get away from the pouring rain) for 30min, and left Nara after having a lunch near the train station. Its no fault of the park or the deer. I must say it was interesting to see such polite deer, wish I had the chance to feed them crackers and interact with them more.",Tripadvisor

"Climbing Mt Fuji seems to be all about making money. Just getting there cost ¥6000 (return by bus from Shinjuku, Tokyo) and though adequate , the bus felt cramped and not particularly comfortable. It took almost three hours with multiple stops (including one ten minute coffee break).
The next thing you will notice is how expensive everything is. All the shops at 5th station seem to have been imported directly from an airport departure terminal with prices to match. Filter coffee is ¥4-500 and any food item will be at least ¥400. So a snack and coffee will cost you a minimum of ¥700 - ¥900.
We followed the standard Yellow route and it took about 6 hours to reach our lodge. What struck me was how little was on offer during the hike.
Be warned! the weather forecast was completely wrong (It said clear and beautiful with a light breeze), it rained almost all the way. There were no shelters, no wind breaks. The lodges sell snacks / coffee for ¥4-500 a piece (consumed in the wind and rain) and offer to 'brand' your walking stick for ¥3-¥500 a pop. Wooden walking sticks are sold at 5th station and 'stamps' are available at each station. This branding takes about 30 seconds and is ludicrously overpriced. Of course these things are optional as is the ¥1,000 Fuji preservation 'donation' asked for when you start out.
We arrived at our lodge soaked having walked in rain almost all the way. The owners (who were very hospitable) asked us to put all our wet gear (including our backpack in large plastic bags and there it stayed until we left at 2.30am. There were no drying facilities. Food is prepaid and included in the ¥13000 accommodation fee. It's basically airline food (Reasonable portions) with a preordered choice of Hamburger or fish (I think) Sleeping is a mattress in a cubical or on the floor of the dining area (Very, very noisy including snorers). You are woken at 2am - eat your supplied Japanese style Bento breakfast and head up. On the way down there is nowhere to buy a snack or get a drink. I think I remember one toilet block.
The income!: Our lodge was full. When you think about it. ¥13,000 per person plus incidentals (people where buying hot cholate / coffee / at ¥400 a pop. I would imagine almost everyone spent at least ¥15-18,000 ($150 Including stay cost) and all of this for around 8 hours of accommodation and two simple meals.
The high cost is blamed on the location. (did I mention the mandatory ¥200 to use the toilet?). There were 180 people in our lodge. 180 x (lets say an average of) ¥15,000. That's around ¥2,700,000 = about $20,000 income per night. 7 days a week for three months. That's $1,800,000 for 8 hours of accommodation and two simple meals. I have not included the stick branding and other 'extras'.
So, you are likely to be spending around $150 for your 8 hour stay. The lodges can can get away with this because everyone charges the same and Japanese people don't complain. From an overseas visitor's point of view it's a one off experience and so we just accept it I guess. However, when you break the costs down - it's obviously just a massive money making enterprise.
After saying all this - If you climb and descend Fuji in a day (You need to be very fit.) Bring your own food and drink - refuse all requests for 'donations', it's almost free.",Tripadvisor
"Lots of ""wild"" deer that are fed by all the tourist. Adjust to the temple so it is easy to go from one to another. This could be terrifying for small children because the deer can become aggressive if you have food.",Tripadvisor
奈良国立博物館で開催されていた空海展のためにわざわざ「二人以上でないと」乗車させないような特急に乗って訪れました。平日の何でもない日なのに、出会う人は９割がたインバウンド・・・驚きですね。何の変哲もない単に餌を求めて寄って来る鹿さんがいる、辺り一面糞だらけで踏まないように注意しながらでないと歩けないと云うだけの公園なのに。大昔からの寺社とそれらが点在しているので結ぶ道に風情がある、程度の公園でした。,Tripadvisor

"Debo reconocer que esperaba una ciudad pequeña, con su parque.
Para visitar los templos más reconocidos, en especial el Todaiji con su Buda gigante, el santuario KASUGA con sus faroles, o la pagoda,( en refacciones ) se debe ingresar al parque.
No siempre el terreno es plano, Presenta desniveles que deben subirse para llegar a alguno de los sitios.
Los caminos internos, rodeados de muchos árboles, destacándose en la época del año en que fuimos, los cerezos en flor.
En el camino, hay ciervos que están acostumbrados al contacto con humanos. Se acercan con confianza a pedir comida ( en ocasiones vimos como husmean y muerden bolsos y mochilas en búsqueda de alimentos).
Resulta simpático, antes de darles de comer( hay puestos que venden galletitas especiales) hacerles una reverencia, ya que los ciervos, la responden.

"Could potentially be a nice park, but it is ruined by the ill-tempered deer overrunning the place. The park managers have contributed to the problem by encouraging vendors to sell ""deer crackers"" to feed the deer. While it's better to feed the deer what are presumably healthy food than potato chips and cookies, they should not be fed by humans at all. The deer are all overfed and unhealthy in appearance. Moreover, they are very aggressive toward anyone they spot having food. This is not how parks should be managed!",Tripadvisor
"If you take the JR line you'll be farther away and have to pay to take the very crowded local bus or walk a little farther to see the deer. Kintetsu Nara station is a much closer and like a five minute walk to your first deer encounter.

Nara Park is really like a lot of different parks and temple areas next to each other. You can hop off at the earlier bus stops if you came from JR station and walk around to the other deer locations instead of cramming in to the last stop. There's deer walking in the roads and some, unfortunately, have been known to get hit by cars. I saw one deer who looked to be injured and limping through the street.

The deer can be aggressive if they see you bought the crackers. Some would crowd people and attack them when they saw so beware if you have small children or physical issues. Some will bow to you and if you don't feed them they'll stop bowing and move onto others. It's cool to see them roam around and expect the higher tourist prices at the shops nearby for Cremia or other snacks. I didn't realize how they can sound like a horror movie when they scream out to each other. Watch where you step too, there are some very heavy poop areas for those not paying attention.",Tripadvisor
"My first hike above 3000m.
Decided to do a night hike to witness the sunrise on the peak. Weather wasn't great at first and it rained quite heavily for the first half of the trek. This made us quite cold and uncomfortable so we payed quite a lot to sleep in a mountain hut for a few hours.
As a person who relies heavily on glasses, the rain, wind and darkness made the route slightly risky, however there was a rope to hold onto most of the way on the Yoshida trail.

We woke up at around 4am to finish the hike to the top.
Spectacular views of the sunrise, lots of people were there to witness this.",Tripadvisor
"This temple is nestled among beautiful gardens and ponds making the pictures of this striking temple very easy to capture. Every vantage point shows the beauty of this must visit temple.

"I hiked Mt Fuji in July of 2021 from the 5th station to the summit and it was an incredible experience. I stayed at station 8 to catch the sunrise. Unfortunately, with 60mph wind gusts and rain there was no sunrise, the weather was brutal at the summit. It was still an amazing adventure and incredible mountain. I spent many years in mountainous areas and know that the mountain can change at any minute so I came prepared. I did see the mountain from the pagoda twice, one day it was cloudy and the other day it was clear. I feel it's luck of the draw whether you will see Fuji or not. I recommend climbing Fuji and enjoying it from a distance. I wish to come back in the winter to see it with snow. During the summer the base is nice and green. Mt Fuji is incredible.",Tripadvisor

By the time we reached 5th station, we found out that they were no longer allowing vehicles to enter for safety reasons. We couldn’t see the peak due to the snow. There is a shrine on the grounds, so I went there for a little bit before heading back to the bus.

"The Nara deer park seems to be a must see considering travel guides and YouTubers. Indeed, visiting and feeding the nodding deer is quite enjoyable. Rice crackers are sold for 500 Yen. I fear the animals are not totally healthy because of the unbalanced diet. The deer look a bit more scruffy than in other places.",Tripadvisor
"We arrived around 10. It was pretty packed. The deer in the intial area of thr park are very aggressive and will go after you even if you don't have food. The deer in the upper park area are much calmer. It cost 200 yen to get a pack of crackers. Break the crackers in half to make them last longer, then put them out of sight so you don't end up with a herd of deer after you. If your child is shorter than the deer, definitely stand with them. I felt the deer were pushier towards my short statured 8 yr old who, despite getting nibbled and pushed by deer, had a great time. I did not. I do question if this park truly meets the animal welfare guidelines.",Tripadvisor
"The Park itself is very bbig and there are a surprisingly high number of deer, make sure you buy some biscuits from a vender nearby and keep them hidden, just take one out at a time otherwise the deer will chase you if they can see them.

Please beware of the young as mother deer will protect their young, saw a few tourists being chased off screaming get that cute photo with a baby deer.",Tripadvisor

"We took the Kintetsu Limited Express train from Kyoto and getting there and back was a breeze. Followed a very helpful half day itinerary we found on Inside Kyoto, so we got to see the highlights without wasting time on a very humid day. The best part was Isuien Gardens, one of Japan’s finest, where we had the very special experience of eating lunch in a tea house with the most stunning view. Toilets and refreshments widely available in the park and signage is good. The deer stink and people should not be feeding them. Having both been really sick with Lyme Disease caught from ticks, it made us shudder seeing people pet them. Just don’t!",Tripadvisor

Hay montones de ciervos. Compramos comida y se volvieron un poco locos. Conviene comprarla y esconderla en el bolsillo y sacarla poco a poco cuando tu quieras.

"Ok...so the larger grounds of the park, when you can get away from the crowds, are nice. And I think I would have liked this place better if we had not gone during Golden Week. But...truthfully...it was all kind of problematic. On the day, the deer we so overfed and wiped out that they were all - and I mean ALL, hundreds and hundreds of them - lying on the ground incapacitated, with people still trying to stuff crackers in them. Again, it was super hot and a national holiday and packed with people. If we went earlier, on a rainy weekday, some time in ...like...February...it might have been better. And I say all this recognizing the fact that I was one of the tourists contributing to all the over-tourism so, indeed, was myself part of the problem. If I had done due diligence and educated myself beforehand, I might have considered not going. I failed to do that so, yes, my bad. But I do think the authorities need to get a handle on overfeeding the animals. They looked unwell and unhappy.",Tripadvisor

"Booked several months ahead for one of the last days of climbing for the season. Luke (principal) gave very detailed information regarding kit and trek details. We were picked up by car from our Tokyo hotel for an under 2 hour journey to the mountain. Our guide was Andy, a Kiwi but fluent Japanese speaker was excellent, giving us the full benefit if his experience on the mountain. After a few hours trekking on the first day much of it in nasty cold wet conditions. We reached our hut for the night, a chance to dry out a bit. We had dinner and an early night. At 04:20 we rose to have breakfast and head for the summit which we reached with a clear sky enabling us to do the circuit of the summit. Which we learned was not possible that day before due to heavy cloud cover. Andy was talkative and supportive throughout, always encouraging us and taking our minds of the aching limbs. Andy encouraged us to go a full circuit at the top even though he was due to take another group up as soon as we reached the last gate. After a celebratory lunch Luke the proprietor drove us back to Tokyo stopping off at Starbucks at our request.

"There is really one scenic place in the whole temple. Granted, it's beautiful, but it is so very crowded and the golden building is very recently built. The whole place is small. We walked around and before we know it, we have exited the temple! There is a distinct mercantile feel to this place, in addition to the obligatory trinkets buying stations, there are 2 places where tourists are not discouraged to throw their coins to a bowl in the ground for ""good luck"". I don't know, just feels much more like a tourist place than a place of worship or culture to me.
In other temples, like Arashiyama, or Fushimi Inari, there is a whole mountain to walk around and look at. That's not true here.",Tripadvisor

"For whatever naive reason, I somehow thought that Mt. Fuji always had snow on it. Silly me. MY FAULT. But I don't ever recall seeing a picture of Fuji that didn't have snow all over it. But I have a bunch of them now. And if you look at my pictures, you may see Fuji without snow on it for the first time too.

So I GOOGL'd it to see how many bald Mt. Fuji pictures I could find. After scrolling through hundreds of them I could find only 4. And a couple of those even had some patches of snow on the edge. Many times it hides behind clouds. But clouds don't count.

I rated it ""average"" mostly because of MY stupidity AND the fact that it is an incredible mountain that I just went to at the wrong time of the year (August). That aside, it is a long ride from Tokyo to get to and from it ... the better part of 6 hours. But it is big. So big that I could even see it from our cruise ship as we departed Yokohama (check out my cloud-covered picture of it).

OK. It had no snow on it. But I see lots of barren mountains around me that are better looking ""in the buff"" than Fuji.

MY RECOMMENDATION: Make sure to research it so that you will see it snow-capped as you would expect. But whenever you go I can assure you that the Japanese you meet will be some of the most welcoming people you will ever meet in the world. I got more ""thank yous"" in one day than I hear in a year in the US.",Tripadvisor

It is best to go as early as possible - before 09.00. Definitely worth a visit for the serene atmosphere and scenic walk.,Tripadvisor
"Quite an experience. Public transportation is a bit difficult so we use taxi from Emanichi JR station.
It is a big site with the very impressive Golden Pavilion. We were lucky to catch the maple foliage as well.
A good site to enjoy the garden.",Tripadvisor
"As we drove through the woods to reach level five of Mount Fuji it was very dark and very fogy. We could hardly see ahead of the bus. I wondered why we going up to the mountain if we could not see anything. However, when we arrived at the fifth level the sun came out. The mountain was not visible as it was cloud covered. Shortly after our arrival the clouds floated away revealing the entire mountain. The clouds kept coming and going.The mountain was not spectacular to me. The views of the lakes and the city below was not possible while I was there because of thick fog. There are souvienir shops and a shrine on the fifth level. You can drive up to the fifth level, if you wish to go further up you may hike as far as level ten of the mountain during hiking season. It was not hiking season when I was there. The fog had lifted on our way down the mountain so the drive down through the woods was very scenic. In my opinion if you want to go up the mountain do not be deterred by fog it can all be gone by the time get up.",Tripadvisor
"受付付近スタッフの対応は最低レベルでした。ペット同伴のため駐車場から受付に行く間3回チェックがありました。もちろんたくさんの観光客が居るから当然です。
ですが、最後のチェックで背の高い眼鏡のスタッフがカートのふたを何度も叩いたためペットが吠え出すと、
これは駄目だ中には入れられない。
私は叩いてない。
私も飼ってたから。
などの言い訳を続けるばかりでした。
カートがしっかり閉じられているかの確認は理解できますが、顔の前を何度も叩かれれば恐怖しかありません。動物を飼っていたなら？わからないのか。

"I just had the opportunity to visit this amazingly beautiful temple again this year. The walk up to the temple is easily manageable (I’m an active early 70’s senior ). The views of the temple are incredibly beautiful and serene. If you are lucky enough to travel to Kyoto, you must visit this temple.

It was quite busy while we were there, mostly with school age children. The crowds are managed well, and did not detract from the experience.",Tripadvisor
"I came when the temple opened at 9AM. When I went (mid-December), there were still some red leaves - beautiful! I was only here for about 20-30 minutes because albeit the temple is absolutely gorgeous, there isn't much else to do here. If you only have one or two days in Kyoto, I wonder whether this is the right place to visit. Nevertheless, the gold is breathtaking and there are many vantage points to admire and take photos of the temple.",Tripadvisor
This is the most beautiful temple I have ever seen! We had such beautiful weather and were lucky that there wasn’t too many tourists when we visited mid afternoon. Every angle was amazing and picture perfect. I highly recommend anyone visiting Kyoto to visit this location as the temple and the gardens are absolutely gorgeous.,Tripadvisor

"A comfortable coach took us through typical Japanese scenery to a coach and train terminal in the village at the bottom of Mt. Fuji. We had hoped for clear views and an actual visit to the mountain, but, unfortunately the mountain kept disappearing in low cloud and was only barely visible at times, so we did not actually visit the mountain, but had a good time in the village and a beautifully prepared meal with drinks in a side street restaurant at a very reasonable price. We departed on the return journey just prior to 6 pm and arrived back in Tokyo just after 8 pm.",Tripadvisor
Definitely one of the places to visit . Very picturesque . Went there via the Sky hop bus. Not much to see besides the temple itself,Tripadvisor
Came here as part of guided tour of Kyoto. Stunning views of the golden temple reflected in the lake. You were unable to enter any of the buildings but the walk around the gardens was lovely. Lots of visitors so it didn’t feel very tranquil.,Tripadvisor
"Autunno tardivo foliage incipiente ma non dominante eppure l'atmosfera c è, pioggerellina compresa. Tantissimi turisti, soprattutto giapponesi, ordinati miti estasiati anche di fronte ad uno stagno ad un pino contorto a un ginko tutto giallo. Figuriamoci di fronte al Padiglione d'oro finemente restaurato che brilla riflesso nell'acqua. Fiabesco palazzo che rimanda al mondo di Mille e una notte, ad un'epoca dorata che favoleggiamo al di là della storia. Piacevole la passeggiata nella foresta di bambù rilassante la pausa con thè verde addensato da uno sbuffo di panna.",Tripadvisor
"We decided to climb Mt Fuji during the off season, we arrived in Kawaguchiko on October 1st, and had set our hike up to Mt Fuji the following day. Our route was the Yoshida Trail, starting from the 5th Subaro Station. It’s imperative that you do your own research on climbing Mt Fuji especially during the off season. It’s not illegal to climb but there are no open facilities or emergency services if you get injured during the hike. We started our hike around 3:40 am. When arriving at the trailhead, it’s “blocked” by a huge sign that says the trail is closed. Ignore it and enter from the side. The trail is a steep incline from the beginning, get used to it because it gets steeper as you get closer to the summit. As a experienced hiker, It took me 6 hours to reach the summit, and around 3 hours for the descent. Mid top hiking boots are recommended, as are layers of down, fleece, and wind/waterproof shell because the weather changes drastically during the hike. Minimum of 2 liters of water, however I carried 3L and it was perfect. Keeping hydrated and taking short but efficient breaks during the hike is the key to success in summiting Fuji. When hiking off season, be smart and listen to your intuition. Unless you are highly experienced, do not attempt alone or find others on the trail and stick to their pace. Be smart.",Tripadvisor
"Well worth visiting, it's particularly beautiful in the Autumn sunshine but, once walked around the temple, there is little else here to see.",Tripadvisor
"In preparing for my Fji climb I looked for info on the experiences of others and found a few accounts. There were many on how it took people in their 20s and 30s to ""do the climb in 3 hours"", that ""it wasn't that hard and I'm not even in that great of shape"". I found one honest account of having to turn around and call it quits.

Here is my honest account of my experience.
I'm a 53 year old female. I live at sea level and hike 15-20 miles a week. Most altitude gain I ever get is about 3500 feet. So I guess I could call myself an avid hiker. I also do yoga once a week and ride a bicycle frequently. I'm in decent shape and healthy but by no means an athlete.

My friend and I did the Yoshida Trail Sept 3-4, 2019. We stayed at a hut at the 8.5 station. My friend lives in Alaska and runs 5-10 miles a day. He is 61 years old. He could have done the climb faster but he stayed by my side the entire time (thank you J.L).

Don't let anyone fool you. Climbing Mt Fuji was very hard. I will never do it again. I am incredibly proud of my accomplishment and I definitely use my bragging rights. We started from the 5th station. It took us 6.5 hours to get to the 8.5 station where we spent the night. There was a considerable amount of rock SCRAMBLING. I didn't anticipate this. I found this very challenging. I used my hands to help me climb and had to be careful to not scrape them.

TIP NUMBER ONE: Remember to hydrate and bring food for fuel. You are using A LOT of energy. We brought 6 liters of water for the two of us. I drank most of it. My friend thinks he is super human and I will admit he is a little bit of a freak of nature. He ended up getting bloody noses from dehydration and I had a told you so moment. I drank what I thought was a lot of water and used the toilet 3 times, barely peeing much at all. That was all during ascent and descent. We brought snacks from 7-11. We ate everything.

TIP NUMBER TWO: Either pack anything you want to keep dry in plastic bags or get a backpack cover. We started off in shorts and t-shirt and had gloves and hat on by the end. It rained enough to get my hiking boots wet through to my socks. You will want to put on rain gear and have something dry to change into when you get to your hut. In the morning I was cold and happy I had my light weight down jacket, which I was grateful had dried over night.

The staff at the hut were very friendly, helpful and organized. They showed us where we could change, where we would be sleeping and give us our dinner. I was so exhausted and feeling the altitude by now. I knew I needed to eat so I forced myself to eat the meal even though I didn't have much of an appetite. I then went to my assigned sleeping spot, took some Ibuprofen and anti nausea stuff and collapsed into my nest, grateful to be horizontal.

I thought I would fall right to sleep since I was exhausted. I don't think I slept more than and hour. Maybe 2 in 15 minute increments. A sleeping bag on the floor at 53 is NOT comfortable. I can't sleep on my side on a hard surface without my hip hurting. So I was on my back the entire time. Which was also not comfortable. They pack you in like sardines and the kid next to me was sound asleep (I could sleep on a rock in my 20's too) and leaning on my arm. I spent considerable time trying to politely get him to nudge over. I was already awake at 1:45 am when the lights got turned on so everyone can get up and get out the door to make it to the summit to see the sunrise.

By 3 am we were out the door. It took an hour to get ourselves together. From the reading I did prior to trip, it was going to take us 90 minutes to get to the summit from the 8.5 station. It took us 2.5 hours. This was due to a couple of things. There were a lot of people on the trail so things were slow but the altitude took a toll on 99% of the hikers. People were throwing up. Large groups were stopping to catch their breath. We were stopping to catch our breath. We probably had to stop every 5-10 minutes to rest. People were stopping to take pictures. Also there was MORE ROCK SCRAMBLING. I was getting discouraged as I neared the summit. I know it was due to the altitude but I started to cry. It got to the point that all I could do was put one foot in front of the other with great concentration and effort and still it seemed like I wasn't getting any closer to the summit even though I could see it. I tripped a couple of times, I was so tired and most likely disoriented from the altitude and also dehydrated. I told my friend to stop talking to me as it was too much effort to listen and walk at the same time.

TIP NUMBER THREE: bring a head lamp!! I brought a $7 piece of junk from Target. Wish I had spent the extra money on something decent. You will be hiking in the dark if you spend the night in a hut. A lot of people had head lamps and this shed some light on the trail but not enough to feel confident or safe or not annoyed.

TIP NUMBER FOUR: If you are sensitive to cold like I am (I live in Southern California) make sure you have gloves and hat. If the altitude doesn't get you, your attitude will. Were climbing in September.

Made it to the summit in time for the sunrise. One of the most glorious events of my life. Words cannot describe the elation I felt. Once in a lifetime experience. Wouldn't change a thing. Totally with the effort. I am in love with life.

My friend took sometime to walk around at the summit. I sat down and closed my eyes. Spent some time focusing on my breathing, enjoying the feeling of the sun on my face. Grateful for everything.

Hike down was about 3-4 hours. Knees on fire. It's a different trail down, no rock scrambling. Just a nice wide trail but steep. Go find yourself an onsen and have a soak after you get back to wherever you are staying. Better yet, check into a luxury hotel like we did and give yourself some well deserved pampering.",Tripadvisor

"Went with a group from Tokyo 'club gets'. Didn't train and don't hike regularly but found ascent handy enough (in my early thirties). Almost didn't get to go up due to a typhoon but luckily it passed leaving clear skies and great conditions. If you're in relatively good shape you can probably do the hike without a guide in a day but if you prefer having everything taken care of and a trip to an onsen after, the guided tour group is worth it. They arrange transport to the 5th station, guides up the mountain, and a stay in a mountain hut before you reach the summit for sunrise. All in all a nice experience, probably should have brought sticks for the decent (knee's and ankles were pretty sore after) but this is a fairly common comment. Great views and a rewarding feeling when you reach the summit. Worth doing if you get a chance.

"Despite this being a reconstruction as the original was burnt down, as man made structures go one of the most beautiful sites i saw in Japan in a month. The gold is mesmerising and i was fortunate to have sun and blue sky. Try and pick your day if you can. Its set on a beautiful pond with a stunning garden around it.

I was worried because of all the comments about so many people etc but don’t let this turn you off. Yes there are a lot of people but you will get beautiful photos if you have a small amount of patience . Also time if you have it and space to stand soak up the beauty of this incredible temple in its gorgeous surroundings.
No one is rushing you out!! The complaints about business and getting to places early i have found unnecessary. Less busy then many Sites/ museums, galleries in places like, France, Venice, London… you have come all the way here here don’t miss things .",Tripadvisor
"We had read loads of articles saying you couldn't climb Fuji outside of main season, except we were really keen to give it a go. Staying in Fujiyoshida the first bus up the mountain gets you to Fuji Subaru 5th Station for about 9.45am, and the last bus down leaves at 5.50pm (this bus doesn't run all the way through off-season), so we had 8 hours to get up and back down again.

As 4 fit guys, we made it up and down in no problem, but there was no snow so that made it much easier. Would recommend, awesome views, tough hike but rewarding.",Tripadvisor

This is an absolute recommendation to visit (and spend 2-3 days) in the surroundings.",Tripadvisor
"once you reach the township near the base of the mountain, the view is breathtakingly amazing. if you travelled by self, there are places to stay, horses to rent to climb the mountain! It will take 2 days to reach to the summit as you need to adjust to altitude sickness first on day 1. Worth every penny to be there!",Tripadvisor

通称の金閣寺が有名ですが、正確には鹿苑寺の金箔が張られている舎利殿です。鹿苑寺の境内は一方通行になっていて、総門をくぐったところで参拝券を購入します。参拝料金は500円で、参拝券がお札になっていました。修学旅行生や海外からの旅行者で大変混雑していて、不動堂の先の出口まで、ずっとゾロゾロ連なって歩く感じでした。金閣はどこから見ても美しいと思いますが、鹿苑寺庭園の鏡湖池越しに見る金閣が最も美しいです。,Tripadvisor

One of the most beautiful places I’ve ever been. The famed mountain is well worth the adventure to see and would highly suggest staying somewhere near Gotemba to have a picturesque view every morning.

Positiv: Trotz Riesengedränge hat man alle Zeit der Welt, perfekte Fotos von verschiedenen Positionen aus zu machen.
Dazu bietet der Vormittag bei Sonnenschein nahezu optimale Bedingungen.

We could not go to the 5th Station as snowfall was really bad, so we made do with 4th. It was good enough.

"Pretty easy to find your way there on public transport on the JR Line. Head to Kyoto Station, change to the San-In Line to Saga-Arashiyama Station and then a short 12 mins walk over. From Osaka the entire journey was about an hr.

A key attraction here in Kyoto so naturally not without people. Although I was told this is considered few for a Saturday already, normally it would be even more. While it’s a major attraction, there’s really nothing much here. Just sections after sections of very tall bamboos. Beautiful of course, but there’s just this much one can do and see here. Unless you are some bamboo expert that can tell them apart. Else it’s just thin or thick bamboos.

The area is not that huge, I was pretty much done around the area in 30 mins. There are many little shrines and temples here, some were too far out so I didn’t bother walking over. Some required additional entrance fee so I didn’t bother with it either. Was tempted to go into one of them but after looking at the photos, it looked like a place that would be insta-worthy only in summer.",Tripadvisor
"I visited during the corona virus period without any crowds. The temples, bamboo forest, food and Arashiyama/Kameyama parks were great. My most enjoyable moment though was hiking around Mount Ogura behind one of the observation decks and during the hike there was a lovely couple that offered me sweets too!
I loved it so much that I nearly missed my night tour in Hiroshima.

Be careful though, the terrain is a little rough and the clay will definitely get very slippery after rain.",Tripadvisor
"Very pretty, best visited if the sun is shining as it makes the bamboo forest all the more striking.
Lots to keep you entertained for a morning in the shopping street, although all shops very similar to many in kyoto for tourists.",Tripadvisor

"This magnificent mountain rises up in perfect symmetry. We took the train from Yumoto, very close the hotel Kajikaso at Hakone. It's an exciting ride to the cable car. Then take the cable car to the base of the ropeway. The ride is beautiful and at the end of the ropeway journey, just as you come over the edge mountain, Mount Fuji rises majestically in front of you on the right. It is worth the travel and the wait for a clear day. A must do to complete the bucket list.",Tripadvisor
"９月の平日，午後３時半ころ，嵐山に来てみた。
じつは，車なら近くにある，豆腐屋では，京都で圧倒的人気を誇る，森嘉 (もりか) が，臨時休業だったので，来ることにしたのだ。
老松 (おいまつ) の喫茶に入るつもりだったが，ここの喫茶も休業だった。
通りにある店舗の，３割くらいが休業している。

阪急嵐山駅周辺のホテルに宿泊しましたが、週末にもかかわらず人通りも空いているレストランも殆どなかったです。Web検索して見つけた「あかくら」という和食居酒屋さんが空いていたので食事しましたが、美味しい魚料理をリーズナブル価格で頂けました。嵐山に宿泊される方にはお勧めのレストランです。",Tripadvisor

コロナで外国人が少ないということで初めて紅葉シーズンにでかけました。やはり嵐山が良かったですね。連休は混むというこで前日に訪問しました。良いのは渡月橋のまわりよりも少し上流の静かな川のほとり。竹林の道から山を越えるルートを歩くのが人も少なくお勧めです。,Tripadvisor
12/3に訪問しましたが、すでに紅葉は大部分が枯れてました。とても残念です。お土産屋さんが沢山あり食べ歩きに良いです。平日の昼間は混雑してなくスムーズに見られました。竹林へは天龍寺の庭園から行きました。やはり竹林は幻想的で素敵でした。竹林を抜けるとすぐトロッコの嵯峨野駅です。,Tripadvisor
11月の3連休明けに行きました。さすがに平日ということもあり、密というほどの混雑はありません。渡月橋もそれほど混んでません。外人がいないせいもあるんでしょうが、ゆったりと散策できます。もう、こんな事は2度とないんでしょうね。若い人は着物が多いですね。時間が経つにつれ、人も増えて来ました。結婚式風のカップルを何組か見かけました。紅葉も終盤に差し掛かり、山の方は、あまり赤みが見えません。竹林周辺も人は少なめです。ゆったりと散策出来ます。この時期は、晴れの日が多くていいですね。,Tripadvisor

"京都で最も有名な場所の１つでしょう。京都の観光地、と言われたら嵐山と渡月橋の組み合わせを思い浮かべる方も多いと思います。また、京都で最も有名な紅葉の名所の１つでもあります。京都の紅葉名所はたくさんありますし、人によっては別の場所を挙げる方もいるとは思いますが、京都の紅葉と言われたらかなりの方が思い浮かべる場所だと思います。
今回は紅葉を見る為に訪れましたが、こちらは名所だけあって物凄く込み合う場所ですので、早朝に訪問しました。ちょうど朝日があたり、非常に美しい景色を見ることができました。また、ほとんど人が居ませんでしたから、思う存分に写真を取ることができました。写真を取られる場合は早朝に訪問されることをお勧めします。
なお、JRの嵯峨嵐山からだと少々歩きます。嵐電の嵐山か、阪急の嵐山から行くと良いでしょう。",Tripadvisor

"Il piccolo boschetto di bambu richiama subito alla mente degli appassionati della letteratura classica giapponese la sotira del taglia bambù e della principessa che discese dalla luna. In un ambiente da favola la foresta anche se più piccola di quello che potrebbe apparire, fa da sfondo per i migliori set fotografici del posto. Vicino si trovano tanti piccoli locali e ristoranti, un esperienza un pò fuori porta se si parte da Kyoto, ma che sicuramente ne vale la pena. Godibile anche in inverno.",Tripadvisor

So Happy & Grateful To Be Able To Experience & View One Of Japan Magnificent Mother Nature: Mount Fuji ☺️

DescriptionJapan’s Mt. Fuji is an active volcano about 100 kilometers southwest of Tokyo. Commonly called “Fuji-san,” it’s the country’s tallest peak, at 3,776 meters. A pilgrimage site for centuries, it’s considered one of Japan’s 3 sacred mountains, and summit hikes remain a popular activity. Its iconic profile is the subject of numerous works of art, notably Edo Period prints by Hokusai and Hiroshige.",Tripadvisor

"Located on the western side of Kyoto and a 20 minute taxi ride from the Golden Temple, so good to combine a visit to both in one day trip. My original intention was to visit the Bamboo Grove but then realised that there were so many other things to see in Arashiyama... lots of shrines and temples on the hillsides with fantastic views, stunning scenery to walk through, exploring different paths through parks and quiet narrow residential roads leading to all sorts of interesting sights, on the other side of the river is a monkey park and then there is the World Heritage Site of Tenryuji Temple and Garden. The main street has tons of gift shops, snack bars and restaurants... packed with tourists, but I had no problem hailing a cab and getting back to central Kyoto.",Tripadvisor
We are group from India with kulian kumar holidays visited Japan the tour is great way to see mt Fuji our guide Michael was very good knowledge we are lucky to see mt Fuji 5th station in a clear sky,Tripadvisor
"I found it kind of amazing that a few minutes away from the train station was this awesome bamboo forest. Because we were there in January, we did not even sweat walking around. It's not impossible to get pictures where one seems alone in the forest...in January. It might not be the same in the spring and fall where the weather is best for walking. Summer might not be the ideal time to walk around. The bamboo grove itself was wonderful. It was quiet and green and very picture worthy. We did not need a guide as there were maps available and the cell signal is very good. One hour is enough to see what is here.",Tripadvisor

"Questa spettacolare foresta di bambù che si stagliano altissimi verso il cielo induce davvero a classificarla un luogo misterioso. Siamo giunti al calar della sera all'inizio del percorso e ci siamo addentrati in questo luogo dal fascino oscuro incrociando gli ultimi visitatori che ne uscivano. La nostra visita è stata accorciata dal calare delle tenebre che ci hanno costretto a fare ritorno,ma non per questa è stata meno bella.",Tripadvisor
"Again, we used our JR Pass, this time to take the JR train to Saga-Arashiyama Station. It took about half an hour.
We followed the flow of crowds. It was quite a distance. We were strolling and enjoying the scenery of Japanese houses when we caught sight of light brown bamboo groves. We thought those were the famous 'Arashiyama Bamboo Groves' and were rather disappointed, until the younger ones laughingly told us those were not it, that the actual Bamboo Groves was still a distance away.
Excitedly, we quickened our pace. When we finally caught sight of the actual green Bamboo Groves, we were very happy and began taking pictures. However, as we continued to walk about a further 10 metres or so, we all caught our breath!! At a distance away, the place where the path split into two, with more light around that intersection, was the most awe-inspiring, mesmerizing scenery ever! We were totally speechless and enthralled!
Wow! So, this was it! How delighted we were! My sisters quickly took videos. Because of the ongoing crowds, it was rather hard to take personal pics.
And it was quite an impossible feat to catch what we really saw with naked eyes on handphone! It took us quite sometime, using different spots and angles. We gave up in the end. Perhaps it would need a professional cameraman. As it was, we had to make do with what we caught.
We continued to walk to the exact spot which had so captivated us, but it was not as beautiful there, as from a distance.
The younger ones were anxious to finish the climb to the peak, to see monkeys and left us to explore the bamboo groves on our own.
Truly, this is a 'must-visit' if one visits Kyoto. We were so glad we made it.",Tripadvisor
Went to Arashiyama in the evening and there were not too many people. Good and peaceful stroll in the bamboo forest when there are not too many people around especially after visiting the nearby garden. Easy walk if you have older folks or children. 10-15mins walk from Arashiyama station and there are some shops/eateries along the way so you won’t find too boring a walk.,Tripadvisor
"Visited here in January, it was cold and it was crowded but not overwhelming. It was a pleasant experience. We chose not to see the monkeys, we stopped and had some tempura and warm sake. Very glad we visited here, we didn't spend more than a few hours here, but very happy we experienced this beautiful zen day.",Tripadvisor
"As per all reviewers has mentioned, it's a very nice experience if there are very little around. So please come early to experiece the bamboo path.

A recommendation would to actually go through the Tenryuji temple as it was a very nice scenic place and exiting via the top exit which then starts you on the path. This way it is a little more wholesome than just dropping by the path which is rather short.

At the end of the path if you started from Tenryuji's temple exit you can cut towards the public park, use the public toilet (since I didn't see anywhere nearby) and make your way upwards towards the observation deck or downwards towards the Katsura river which is nice on its own and then walk towards Arashiyama Station ( the tram and not the JR train at Saga-Arashiyama). The area around Arashiyama Station has many shops for picking up souvenirs or getting some food.

Once done, take the tram (Keifuku Randen) which is a nice experience as it used to serve the whole city and if it interests you, drop at Omuro Ninnaji where you can experience Ninnaji Temple, Ryoanji Temple and the most famous one, Kinkakuji Temple as they are all within the same area, reachable by walking or bus, which we took.",Tripadvisor

"We recently visited the forrest as part of a tour. There was just people everywhere so get there early. It was a lot smaller than I thought only 2 actual walk ways of bamboo trees, you could do a walk up the mountain but it stated it was around 3 hours which we did not have time for being on a tour. Good to see on a tour wouldn’t have gone all the way out there though if we weren’t on a tour.",Tripadvisor

Make sure to watch the short video about his life and works. The tea room and surrounding gardens are breath-taking. Even saw a monkey warning sign on the garden trail, but no monkeys were seen...would have been exciting though.",Tripadvisor

"Brought here by our tour guide after visiting some temples earlier in the day.
This walk along the bamboo path and then along the river was an excellent way to reflect and enjoy the natural surrounds. Lots of tourists had the same idea which took some of the enjoyment away but it is certainly worth the effort to visit this area in Kyoto.
The Main Street in Arashiyama caters for the tourists but there are some excellent places to pop in and try a tempura udon to recharge for a pit-stop.
Recommend++",Tripadvisor
"This is easy to do on your own and in a day, however, I do think if you have only one day and you haven't done much research on the area, the one day tours that are available from Tokyo would be best.
We took the Express from shinjuku to otsuki. About 2320 yen one way. Takes about 1 hour. Then at Otsuki we got another Express to kawaguchiko station (note the Express is 400 yen more but is only 10min shorter in time). Price for the ticket is 2280yen return.
Once we reached kawaguchiko, we walked about 10 min to the kawaguchiko lake. Super easy walk! There is a boat running every 30 mins and goes on a 20min tour on the lake. I believe you get to see the mountain from the boat. The ropeway is on the other side of the road to the boat ticket office. You get a special price if you buy both tickets together. Only 1600yen for the ropeway and boat.
Our biggest issue today was we ran out of cash after having lunch. The atm at Lawson's didnt accept our card so we had to walk back to the station to use an atm. Then we walked back to the boat and they were fully booked for the next hour! We then decided that because we had seen mt Fuji from the train station that we were happy to go back to Tokyo. We had seen what we wanted to see.
If you have plenty of time, I think this would be a nice place to stay overnight. Otherwise one day is feasible. I also think the one day tours are a good option if you are pressed for time.",Tripadvisor
If you are in Kyoto this is a stop you must make simply because it is so iconic. It’s only a 20 minute train ride from Kyoto station on the JR line. The monkey garden is nearby but it closed at 4:30pm and we missed it.,Tripadvisor
"It was fun walking from the Arashiyama train station towards Arashiyama bamboo forest. The bamboos look better in pictures 😀 Torii gates were amazing. While in this area, there’s a lot to explorer",Tripadvisor
"If you rely on the world of Google, you think you can do Mt Fuji in a Day trip- and sure, it's possible to do that if you get up and are on a train at the crack of dawn and have nothing else planned for the day.
That's where I made the mistake.
But it would be lovely and more relaxed to stay 1 or 2 nights out at five lakes to truly immerse yourselves around the beautiful of this Mountain.
Prepare for snow- even in Spring!",Tripadvisor
"Once you visit the mountain, you will be surely stunned and mesmerized by its beauty.
After all, you cannot be helped to come back to see her. That is a mysterious charm of the mountain.",Tripadvisor

"I was lucky - good view from 5th station as cloud broke. Is an iconic must see.

The shops/food stations are the usual.

The temple just behind the shops is worth a quick visit.

I went on a day trip from Tokyo (but leaving to go elsewhere at end) and that was the easy way to get there I think. Roads are good up to the 5th (at this time of year).",Tripadvisor
"Super busy, can find gardens and forests in the area that are not so much out of the way. The bamboo forest was good but there were a lot of people and it was not as big as I thought. The monkeys were great, also really enjoyed bird watching around the river. Tricky to get a sit down meal.",Tripadvisor

"Much like Mt. Shasta in California, Mt. Fuji rises from the earth in solo fashion, sharing the landscape with no other feature. It dominates the scene and it is striking in its beauty. Weather plays a large role, and the mountain is not always visible, but when she comes out, it is a pure delight.",Tripadvisor
"The town of Arashiyama is primarily located on the main street which starts at the Togetsukyo Bridge (Moon Crossing Bridge) and continues with entrances to the Sagano (Bamboo Forest), and Nonomiya Shrine.
There are plenty of restaurants and souvenir stores along the way.
After walking through the Bamboo Forest, you can visit the Nonomiya Shrine or the Tenryuji temple and gardens. There is a modest entrance fee for the gardens but it's worth it.",Tripadvisor

However, trying to avoid all the tourists while trying to enjoy the sight was quite a task. I guess we arrived too late, large groups of tourists were already there. We enjoyed the area behind the bamboo forest, and the shopping street. Note for the train heading to arashiyama: don't check in at your first stop, you have to pay 220 yen (in cash, or with your ic card) when you get out of the train, regardless of where you get out.",Tripadvisor
Google gave us strange directions when we went to Arashiyama. It said that all the routes ended in a long walk to the bamboo grove. This was not the case as multiple local bus lines stop right at the entrance to the Arashiyama area and after walking past shops and restaurants on a very touristy street we arrived at the bamboo grove in 5-10 minutes. It is not a long walk through the bamboo but its very impressive and worth seeing even despite the crowds. There are further walking trails but without the impressive rows of bamboo so we went back and walked along the river.,Tripadvisor

It was a cold day in Tokyo. We rode the WeBus from our Hotel to Washington Hotel and walked for about 5 minutes to Keio Hotel where the tour to Mt. Fuji and Hakone will begin. We were at bus 8. It was about an hour bus ride to Mt. Fuji and on our way up we were able to see Mt. Fuji. Though it was a bit hazy for it was a cloudy still it looked so beautiful. It took as a while before we reached station 4 (we were supposed to go to station 5 but it was close that day) for there were lots of tourist buses visiting Mt Fuji it was afterall a saturday. When we got to the station it started snowing something my kids were wishing to see and experience. My kids were so excited for it was their first time. But it was freezing cold. After mt Fuji we had lunch a very delicious lunch in a pink restaurant (sorry forgot the name). Then off to hakone for some more sight seeing. The bus took us to Odawara station were we rode the bullet train back to tokyo station. Our tour guide Yoko was very helpful.,Tripadvisor
"Our hot tip...visit after 4:30 or 5pm or later!

We probably arrived after 5 pm. To our astonishment most of the day trippers and tourists had dispersed. It was serene, peaceful and our pictures were stunning! Without the hordes of tourists jostling for a photo op. The light was glorious, warm and very flattering. There was a light breeze and the rustling sound of the leaves was very spiritual! The bamboo much taller than I expected

However, the bamboo grove was not what I expected. There was a large power-line running along the grove which was disappointing! FYI there are rickshaw carriages that transport tourists along a private section of bamboo grove that might be more encompassing?

Is this a top tourist destination...YES but I do not understand the draw. I would have had no qualms to skip it!",Tripadvisor
"Visita alla Foresta di bambù, noi l'abbiamo fatta in autonomia prendendo un treno da Kioto per 3 euro andata e ritorno. Per la verità a parte i soliti templi molto belli sparsi in un grande parco, non c'è molto altro. All'esterno però c'è una bella passeggiata piena di gente con tanti negozi e ristoranti carini fino ad un ponte sul fiume. Non so quanto valga la pena prendere una visita guidata peraltro abbastanza cara.",Tripadvisor
After seeing the beautiful pictures of the Arashimaya bamboo forest I thought of it to be something spectacular. But it's just a small patch of bamboo groove which is very picturesque and every inch was full with people. Thankfully there is a walking trail leading to a river with beautiful ducks. Overall it's OK.,Tripadvisor
"It is a gorgeous looking mountain, perfectly shaped by nature! We were on our way from Kyoto to Odawara (to Hakone to see Mt Fuji). It so happened later that cloudy skies prevented us from seeing Mt Fuji from Hakone.

"Never thought of Mt Fuji as a bucket list item but going there as part of a study tour certainly made me think it should have been right up there with the Pyramids.

We were lucky that the skies were clear and we could see her in all her glory. Such a magnificent sight to see. The lakes around the ‘three volcanoes in one’ Mt Fuji set a surreal experience.

Even more special for me was unexpectedly seeing Mt Fuji from the air when I was flying back on ANA airlines from Kyushu Island (Saga Prefecture). I love the pic I took of Mt Fuji from the air with the plane’s wing with the Japanese flag on it - so special.

All in all, well worth a visit and trying the local blueberry juice and ice-cream (even if it is a freezing cold day)",Tripadvisor

"We had a short visit to Kyoto and found it so easy to get around with a combination of public transport and taxi (to save time). The bamboo forest is busy but it was easy to wander when there were less people, even on a Saturday. The silence, dancing light coming through the bamboo and other worldly feeling made the bamboo forest a highlight of our time in Kyoto.",Tripadvisor
"We drive to the 5 station but the view not fantastic. We were at the lake the view of my Fuji is more beautiful. At the pagoda in the evening the view of Mt Fuji also looks good. But if you have travelled to Takayama-Shi and on the way stopped by Mt Fuji, the MT Fuji is not great to look at as we have seen more beautiful mountain at the alpine route.",Tripadvisor

"Лучше в храм идти ночью или на рассвете, людей меньше, хотя и днём получается поймать моменты, когда в коридорах никого
С туалетами по пути не очень густо, но много палаток/автоматов с водой, сувенирами

Важный момент! Когда заходите на тропу в самом начале будет направо вверх дорожка уходить пустынная, без арок тори, не ходите! Только для отчаянных или любящих спорт! До самой вершины можно по ней подняться, идти минут 40-60, но тропка ведет через лес и крутые ступени, зато народа на ней вообще почти не встречается)",Tripadvisor
"初めての伏見稲荷でしたが千本鳥居が目的でした。
参道を進み鳥居を過ぎると楼門が見え、階段を登り楼門をくぐり中に入ると
拝殿、本殿が控える。
目的の千本鳥居は？と。捜す。
本殿の奥、右側に発見。
鳥居入口までまた１０段くらいの階段。
ここが鳥居の始まり、ということで写真をパチリ。
千本という名称だが、実際には１万本近くこの稲荷山に並んでいるそうな。
完全制覇するには２時間ほどかかるようで、まず挫折。
お手軽？コース的なものもあるようで約３０分くらい。
まず一歩を踏み出す、稲荷山に登るのであるから坂道である。
残念ながら途中でまた挫折。引き返す。

"So this is a must-see if you are visiting Kyoto, but be ready for crowds in the shrine area and the first “flight” of Torii gates. When we had a chance we left the main Torii gate trail and went off towards the bamboo forest and around the back of the mountain. There is a steep trail that leads (so many stairs) to the top of the mountain that is worth the hike. Once at the top we met up with other visitors that had come up the main walk. On the way down the tails was less crowded and there was plenty of photo opportunities.",Tripadvisor

"Aqui la version mas honesta del asunto.
Hemos venido a arashiyama, en 2 ocasiones, la primera a conocer lo mas icónico y turístico y la segunda para hospedanos en un ryo kan que tuviera un onsen privado para tener la experiencia al aire libre. La verdad completamente recomendable, aunque los presupuestos pueden elevarse bastante sobre todo si lo comparas con la economía que encuentras en otras ciudades como tokio y en el mismo kyoto.
Total, aquí en arashiyama no solo esta el bosque de bambú, encuentras también templos históricos e icónicos como Tenryu-ji, en sagaogurayama hay varios templos, jardines hermosos para unas fotografías y alejados bastante del bullicio y de la turisteada, que a eso voy a llegar, y un montón de comercios locales donde comer delicioso si aprecias la gastronomía local.
Ahora, si te vas al bosque de los bambús, tienes pocas opciones para pasarla realmente bien.. o te vas super temprano, digamos a las 7 de la mañana… o te darás cuenta que el dichoso bosque es bastante pequeño, que hay algunas partes vandalizadas (gracias turistas.. o locales… vándalos en fin) y otras partes muy lindas, pero tomarse la foto que quede en condiciones adecuadas, es bastante difícil.
Lejos de eso, es un sitio icónico y turístico, y si tienes oportunidad de visitarlo, yo lo haría… en lo personal insisto, pienso volver por el bendito onsen, del que ya hable o hablaré en otra reseñita.
Nos vemos en Japón!",Tripadvisor
"Ja, der Tempel ist interessant, aber der Ort ist dermaßen überlaufen von lauten Touristen, die sich nicht benehmen können, dass man als jemand, der die japanische Höflichkeit und Ruhe liebt, schnell wieder flüchtet. Der Bambuswald ist ebenfalls komplett überlaufen, ein schönes Foto kann man wahrscheinlich kurz nach Sonnenaufgang machen, aber ab 8 Uhr wird es wahrscheinlich schon zu voll… Läden voller Kram, völlig überteuert, die Restaurants ebenso…
Falls man auf das Standard-Touristending steht, und sich unter Massen fetter, schwitzender Leute so richtig wohl fühlt, ist hier der richtige Ort.",Tripadvisor
"Walk around endlessly in this charming area. Lots of places to see, restaurants, food carts to try. Many souvenir shops around the area as well. As usual convenient and efficient public transportation, you will never get lost. And if you do, rest assured that the Japanese locals will help you find your way - visited March 2015",Tripadvisor
"Ever wanted to feel like an ant? In this forest you do: Bamboo is the largest member of the grass family, so you are literally walking through grass - with you being ant-like small and the grass being extremely big. A truly enchanting experience - and what a feast for a panda!",Tripadvisor
"The majestic bamboo forest is worth a visit but be prepared for the crowds.

If you are coming to see the forest best to plan your day to include many other sites in the near vicinity.

If you are looking for the perfect selfie pics amongst the bamboo you’ll find it very difficult due to the lighting & the crowds.

This is definitely a once & done tourist attraction.",Tripadvisor

Il ne faut pas s'arrêter à la forêt de bambous qui est sympathique mais devient rapidement un spot Instagram impossible à traverser.
Seul intérêt : regarder les animaux se bousculer pour 1m2 de terrain 😂

Trouvez les champs de lotus.

"This bamboo forest is definitely one of those over-rated arrtractions in Japan. Yes, it's picturesque, but there are many more bamboo forests throughout Japan that are less crowded. We arrived around 8. There were about 50 people by 8:30 the tour buses had arrived and the masses came in.
Bottom line if you must go just to say you've done it, go before 8 or other reviews have mentioned after 1600.",Tripadvisor

I had roughly 2 minutes of perfect view time to stare at this huge mountain. The far view at and shape of this mountain has something truly magical. Reserve a window seat at the Shinkansen and prepare your camera in time when you're close to Mt Fuji, the pictures you shoot will be amazing.",Tripadvisor

"Ho visitato Arashiyama e la foresta di bamboo in compagnia di mia moglie in occasione del nostro recente viaggio in Giappone.
Questa zona di Kyoto, di gran lunga la più bella della città, è raggiungibile col JR (quasi una rarità a Kyoto) prendendo il treno della Sagano Line dalla stazione di Kyoto (solitamente binario 32-33); la fermata della vostra destinazione sarà Saga Arashiyama, da lì vi separeranno poche centinaia di metri.
Il parco è meraviglioso, un'esplosione di colori, soprattutto in autunno, periodo in cui lo abbiamo visitato.
Per visitarlo tutto occorrerà mezza giornata.
Di sicuro è stata l'attrazione che mi è piaciuta di più, di gran lunga meglio di tutti i templi di Kyoto che dopo un po' cominciano ad annoiare dato che spesso sembrano apparentemente tutti uguali.
Non commettete il mio errore, stavo andando via senza visitare questa parte della città proprio per dare priorità al resto, quindi ho potuto dedicare solo poche ore per la passeggiata.",Tripadvisor

È la famosa foresta di bambino fuori Kyoto e mi ha un po’ deluso. Per carità è bella con queste canne altissime e spesse con tanti giochi di luce. Purtroppo il luogo è angusto e quindi sempre affollato. Eravamo alle sette del mattino e già c’erano alcune decine di persone….,Tripadvisor

Was surprised to have an Aussie guide on our tour, but Blair was so enthusiastic about our tour and Japan that he made our tour an extremely enjoyable one, until we hit the expressway on the way back to Tokyo the traffic was a nightmare but the tour of mount Fuji was wonderful would recommend it to anyone who visits this beautiful country.",Tripadvisor

"We found this ok, but not fantastic. The Bamboo Grove isn’t particularly big and had quite a crowd. Frankly it felt like it was set up for the Instagram crew to all get their pic’s.

We liked the shops down the street more than the Bamboo Grove.

The bridge at the end was a bonus. In supper it would be fantastic to rent a kayak here, but pretty cold in winter.

If you have time, I’d do this, but if we’re tight in time, it’s not a must do (for us).",Tripadvisor
"After all the hype I had heard about the bamboo forest, I was expecting something more grand. In reality it wasn’t so big and spectacular, and it was extremely crowded and noisy. The area is definitively worth a visit, but I wouldn’t recommend going there only for the bamboo grove. Try climbing Mt. Ogura to the west, or stroll around and enjoy the whole part of town.",Tripadvisor

Bearing in mind we just went through an Arctic Vortex in Chicago a month or so earlier, I mention this fact because we are used to being cold, ice cold.

"Went to the monkey park first, which was a lovely walk and you have a beautiful view at the top, as well as seeing all the monkeys. Then walked into the town and loved the atmosphere with all the shops and restaurants. A great feel. Walked to the bamboo grove - this was very small and also crowded - very disappointing. Am glad we got to see the monkeys and the town so that it was a lovely day.",Tripadvisor
"One of the reasons I visited Japan was to see Mount Fuji with my own eyes. I was able to do this in Hakone. This could be done by taking a Shinkansen to Odawara and then a local bus. It took about an hour by bus, but the view along the way was spectacular. The view of Mount Fuji from Hakone was nothing short of magical. All the facilities were excellent. Expect to see lots of people. You can simply spend one or two hours here without feeling bored.",Tripadvisor
"We visited this place in 2017 (but didn't visit in 2019 during our revisting) and it's already 6 years and so this time round, we decided to come back here.

The Arashiyama Bamboo Grove is another one of Kyoto's top sightseeing landmarks. And standing amid these soaring stalks of bamboo is like one being in another world, its so peaceful and tranquil despite of the crowd and noises just outside the forest along the main roads.

It's nice and very cold and walking around here helped one to destress and relax, to take a break from the busy and hectic lifestyle. One will get to feel the closeness to our mother's nature and it's soothing and calm. I loved the scenic and ambience.

It's definitely worth the revisit.",Tripadvisor
"I visited early October before 8 am. It wasn't crowded, but it was still a decent amount of people. Multiple people were having full on photo shoots for various things so you'd have to stop to not walk through them. There were couple's photos, one looked like it was for maybe a commercial or movie or just a guy having lots of fun dressed up. It's not a big grove so you can do it fairly quickly, but the busier it gets you'll probably have to stop a lot for all the photos.",Tripadvisor
"Ein echt schöner Bambuswald, den man allerdings nicht genießen kann wenn man im Strom mit 1000 Menschen schwimmt. Immerhin ist der Eintritt frei und man kommt mit dem Bus gut hin. Wir haben noch einen Stop in einem japanischen Garten gemacht um uns von dem Trubel zu erholen. Schöne Fotos vom einsamen Wald gibt es nur auf Instagram.",Tripadvisor
This is a great place to spend the day. The trails through the bamboo forest can be a little busy but it’s still an amazing sight and a tranquil place to wander and take some photos. The Tenryu-Ji temple and its gardens are also easily accessed in the same area and are beautiful to visit (¥800 entrance to both). Then wander down to the river and take a right turn to walk along it’s north bank to the park where you may spot the monkeys. Plenty of places around here to grab lunch too and easily reached from central Kyoto on the JR line.,Tripadvisor
c'est joli mais il y a tellement de monde dans un espace finalement assez réduit que le plaisir n est pas là. Les images donnent l impression que la forêt est immense mais ce n est pas le cas. La photo la plus diffusée est un chemin privé uniquement emprunté par les pousse-pousse pour leur donner davantage d 'attractivité et faire d'une photo comme si vous étiez seuls dans la forêt de bambous. A voir mais vous serez déçus.,Tripadvisor

"Went here on a Monday and it was packed Since we did not have an advance ticket, they told us we had to wait in this incredibly long line. While waiting, I used my phone to get advance tickets so we went to that line. Still had to wait for about 30 minutes to then get to a machine and get the actual tickets. Then we had to line up for the elevator and wait at least another 20 minutes. The overcrowding is ridiculous. So when we got to the top and saw the views, very disappointed because it is so high that all the buildings look alike. Much prefer the government building views. This place is overhyped",Tripadvisor
"La altura ya no permite disfrutar correctamente, es casi como si viéramos la ciudad desde un avión. Las ventanas son muy gruesas y están colocadas en una posición que impide tomar fotografías sin reflejo y/o sin los soportes, estorbando. La Tembo Galleria (450m) no es mejor, de hecho tiene un extraño diseño en espiral que no permite rodearla completamente. De igual manera hay muchas partes aisladas con cuerda de terciopelo. Si llegaras a bajar de 450m a 350m, por error (me pasó), no puedes volver a subir. El horario de reservación es fijo (no abierto como en la Tokyo Tower). Para nada vale lo que cuesta. Vale más la pena la Tokyo Tower por la mitad del precio, incluso si no se paga el boleto más costoso.",Tripadvisor
"I’m writing this review in hopes that the management read it. This year I went for my 3rd time to Tokyo Skytree. It was terribly overcrowded. For a place that sells ticketed entry, they need to at least halve the amount of people in there at one time, even two third of the people would be more pleasant. You have to line up to see out the windows and then line up for 20minutes or more to go up each elevator and then line up to come downs. You get literally crammed into the elevators. I run a school trip every 2 years and will now take it off the itinerary, as much as I love the building, everyone hated it this time because of the severe over crowding. I would definitely look for other places to enjoy the view.",Tripadvisor

Good thing to do when visiting Tokyo. It's well designed and there are a lot of shops and restaurants at the bottom of the sky tree. There is also a station (Tokyo Skytree station. But if you want to see Mount Fuji and get some of the best views of Tokyo I wouldn't go on a cloudy day. I would make sure you check the weather for Fuji city which is close to Mount Fuji to double check wether it will be covered in cloud. It has been cloudy when I've gone up the tower so do pick the right day.,Tripadvisor

Surroundings are nice, there is whole shopping mall to explore and loth of japanese products there. View is amazing and while sightseeing you can see some japanese cartoon characters around the building",Tripadvisor
"No puedo decir que el mirador esté mal. Es el más alto de la ciudad. Sin embargo, eso mismo, estando rodeado de nada le hace perder encanto. Tiene dos niveles 350 y 450. Lo que tengo claro es que no merece la pena subir al nivel 450, cuesta unos 7 euros más por persona y se ve lo mismo pero peor porque la cristalera parece que la han diseñado Benito y Manolo.
Y lo último, y probablemente lo que menos me gustó, es que una vez que bajas te meten en un auténtico laberinto de escaleras con tiendas y puestos de comida para que no escapes sin gastar más. Puedo decir que ahí me comí el peor pollo frito de mi vida",Tripadvisor

"Booked a 2 days Fuji Mountian Climb from Willer, including 1 night stay in a mountain hut. The trip was very well run and we were well informed on all maters.
The ""LOVE"" object meeting place in Shinjuku is easy to find and you cannot miss the guide in bright pink vest. The mountain hut provide the much needed warm resting place while it is freezing cold outside. Just don't expect too much 3000m above sea level, no shower but the toilet is reasonably good. You are literally sleeping next to your friend or another member of the tour.

There is 3 English speaking guild to a group of around 20-30 climbers. They know how to pace you. The after climb arrangement is also very good. A big thanks to our tour guide Miko san and Taku san and mountain guide Ken san, and Yama san for this great experience.",Tripadvisor

"Pretty cool if standard observation tower. We bought the extra ticket to go one level up. It was a hazy day so we couldn't see too far, and did not see Mt Fuji, but it's impressive to see the city stretching in every direction. They have a nice gift shop and a station where you can send a postcard with a special postmark. I'm taking off one star because there weren't any places to sit and chill - even the cafe just had a standing counter to eat at. There was also a random anime exhibit on the top floor that some people were excited about but that we didn't think fit the vibe. We didn't do any other towers in Tokyo so we can't compare but this one was nice.",Tripadvisor
Superb views of the city and surroundings. Be sure to have water and patience because you will want to take a billion pictures.,Tripadvisor
"Nous avions réservé les billets en avance mais malgré celà nous avons attendu des heures. Il y avait des rafales de vent et un seul ascenseur en marche... Ce fut très treeees long. Si nous avions su, nous ne serions pas restés. La vue est cependant très jolie ( Nous l'avons fait de nuit) et exposition de Genshin Impact en prime ( pour notre ado ça tombait bien) Longue attente ensuite pour redescendre également, ce qui a gâché notre expérience.",Tripadvisor
"Quel intérêt de réserver un créneau quand on voit qu'il suffit de se présenter à l'accueil pour monter immédiatement ? Résultat : on fait la queue pour accéder à l'ascenseur, on refait la queue pour accéder à l'étage supérieur. Et à chaque fois, c'est 15-20 minutes.
Sinon, ok, c'est haut... mais c'est tout. Il faut dire que Tokyo n'est pas vraiment une ville avec une architecture qui s'apprécie d'en haut.
Bref, totalement évitable.",Tripadvisor
"I know everybody recommends visiting the Mount Fuji, so I will not insist in details.
About two hours travel from Tokyo, on a mountain crossing highway. I recommend to travel during the walking permission season, in order to have the opportunity to escalade the mountain, as much as you can. So inform yourself about that, even it is open almost all the time during the summer.",Tripadvisor
訪れた時は視界が悪く、いい展望とまではいきませんでした。本当は天気のいい日に訪れればよかったんですが・・・。しかし、東京の街の市街地の広さを感じさせることができました。店舗も充実していて、そこで靴を購入させていただきました。,Tripadvisor
"Worth the visit. We had gone to the Tokyo Tower on our previous visit but it pales in comparison. The view from both 350-450m were amazing...although we weren't sure if the views at 450m were that much better than at 350m. It had a glass floor but we didn't find it that special -- especially if you've seen other similar glass floors. We were visiting during the off-season on a weekday so it probably wasn't as busy as usual. That said, the restaurant on the 350m was fully booked so we weren't able to get a table as a drop-in. The base of Skytree offers several floors of food options. Expect to line up during the lunch rush. This is a good place to go together with the Senso-ji Temple since both attractions are relatively close to each other.",Tripadvisor

"Despite the crowds, this is a knockout view of Tokyo, especially at night with the lights stretching seemingly to the horizon. A few activities within the viewing deck itself and a top tip is to head down the stairs to the lower deck which is usually less busy than the upper.",Tripadvisor
"although we booked it was well organised. First stop 350metres. Great views all around Tower. we went down two floors and had drink in cafe.
we paid extra to go to 450m the views the same were better and the glass floor.
Well worth a visit",Tripadvisor
"It’s said that (in a Japanese proverb) that he who climbs Mt. Fuji is a wise man; he who climbs twice is a fool. I climbed Fuji-san twice in my 20s and now for a 3rd time in my 50s- does this make me a bigger fool or does it somehow cancel it out? I must admit- it felt a lot harder this time! The first thing to remember- this is a mountain. It might be pretty accessible, and you can climb it in a few hours- but the conditions up at the summit can change very rapidly- from bright and sunny to temperatures close to freezing with heavy rain and sleet in the space of a couple of hours. We climbed up in freezing rain and high winds that soaked us through, and descended in a mixture of cloud and sunshine that left us burnt on all exposed areas.

Just a point on the mountain huts- the first 2 times I climbed I just climbed overnight, stopped on the top (it was freezing, but at least dry) and then climbed back again. This time, with teenagers, we decided to stay in the one at the top. Yes it was noisy, but that was the guests. Not sure why other reviewers said the staff were rude - we found them great- maybe because we spoke some Japanese and followed basic manners (like take your shoes off and don’t put wet clothes on the tatami, and don’t talk in loud voices at 3am, and 4am and 5am- as a group of North American tourists did in ours).",Tripadvisor
"Extremely crowded there should be a cap on bookings each day. There were literally thousands of people there, and a lot of people pushing and shoving to get through and cram into an elevator. The view was good however was ruined with the amount of people there, you couldn't really see anything.
Won't be going back next time I'm in Japan.",Tripadvisor
"Must-see attraction in Tokyo. This is a great way to see the city, and get a good view of Mt Fuji when the sky is clear. Nice observation deck, and a glass floor that you can stand on to test your courage. Easy to get to from the Tokyo subway.",Tripadvisor
"Excellent hike around mountain for a couple of hours. Hard to find info online so hopefully these pictures will be helpful.
Stairs lead up from next to large building near where cars arrive into main square at 5th station",Tripadvisor
"Purchased our tickets 3 days before we visited and were able to get a prime entry time at 5pm on a Thursday. We went straight to the elevator and were taken to the first stop, the Tembo Deck. We stayed a pretty long time taking pics before getting in line to use the combo part of our ticket to go up to the higher Galleria Deck. I wish we had just gotten in line right away and went straight up the next elevator to the Galleria. Basically the same view, but much less crowded, a few glass floors and some photo opportunities for a small fee. Definitely go at or after sunset, it’s beautiful!",Tripadvisor
"Great drive to top with adventures, food and fun.Horseback ridding and a crazy walk into the suicide forest.",Tripadvisor
"We have traveled from Shinjuku by Train (JR pass) till Otsuki and bought separate pass to reach Fuji. We went during Sakura, hence got a chance to witness cherry flowers and Fuji at same time.

Didn't see the clear view, but we were in hurry to see other places as well. I suggest you to extend here for 1 more day to enjoy this place.

Before reaching, buy the bus pass through online based on your route interest (there are around 3 route options). On the spot ticketing will not be possible due to huge crowd and long queues. So, buy tickets before to save time and energy.",Tripadvisor
Top. Ben organizzata moderna e davvero da non perdere. Ottimo il panorama. Non abbiamo provato il ristorante. Il resto tutto ok,Tripadvisor
"I extended a business trip to Tokyo by two days to hike Fuji-san via the popular Yoshida trail. I arrived with the first Highway bus from Shinjuku and started hiking at around 1:00 pm. After 1300m uphill walking to 3400m, I arrived at the Fuji-san hotel at around 6:00 pm. The place serves simple food and provides sleeping backs. After a few hours of sleep I hit the trail again at 2:00 am. Normally it would take 80 min from here to the top, but the trail was extremely busy already that early and at around 4:40 am I arrived at the top to witness the sun rise 10 min later. Pretty spectacular experience and worth the ‘traffic jam’. Honestly, it was probably for the better to go that slow to avoid altitude sickness.
The way down was fast - a separate trail only for downhill traffic. Bring hiking poles and gaiters to keep the volcanic ash out of your shoes.",Tripadvisor
"Très belles vues, on arrive mieux à repérer les quartiers. Intéressant à faire après avoir effectué un tour de la ville en bus.",Tripadvisor
"Choose your guide wisely - we picked Fuji Mountain Guides but in my opinion, the company is too focus on commercial aspect of the activity. We were given less than an hour at the summit, and we stopped less than 15 mins at every stop on our way up. Enough time only to stamp your stick and for toilet break. At the top, it was so crowded that you had to queue for everything, stamp the stick, toilet, but souvenirs, take pictures, catch the sunset etc. With that limited time given, we were in a rush and did not have the time to enjoy the scenery. The guides were so overly concerned on time, and it was the same going back down. Everything was in a rush and we didn't have time to stop for photos on our way up and down. Unlike our trip to Nepal, the guide introduced us to the mountain and explained the history along the way, compared to our trip to Mt Fuji. We spend quite a lot for this trip and I wished we could have spent more time knowing the mountain. We should have appointed another guide as we did not fully enjoy and appreciate the trip.",Tripadvisor
"You're wondering how you can go to Mt Fuji and not see the mountian? Easy. Go on a day where the cloud cover is low, like we did! We chose to doa bus tour from our Shinjuku hotel ot Mt Fuji and back. Our first ever bus tour. The route was to the 5th station, then a trip around the mountain to Lake Ashi and then up Mt. Hokone. As we traveled around the mountain, it became clear that fog and low cloud was the weather that day upon arrival at the 5th Station. If Mt. Fuji was the only part of this, then this would be a terrible review. It was just completely occulded from view, all day! Even Mt. Hakone was coverd in cloud with visibility of about 50m. Bummer.
However the area surrounding is beautuful and lush and we really enjoyed seeing the countryside. You know, I think we were doomed never to see the mountain. Two Shinkassen trips past it and it was still covered in cloud! Best advice I can give is that if Tokyo is overcast and dull with limited visiability, Mt. Fuji will be as well os don;t go that day.",Tripadvisor
"Incredible views with buildings to the horizon. Truly gives some perspective to the size of Tokyo and it is worth for a visit and walk around. During our visit in June, there was also a celebration of Disney which is a nice addition. Suggest you book tickets in advance because this and other towers may sell out upon your arrival - we learned the hard way with another tower we tried to visit. If you found this review helpful, please indicate so I know where to focus my future review efforts!",Tripadvisor
"My visit to Tokyo Skytree left me with mixed emotions. I chose a Sunday evening in mid-April, and the crowds were overwhelming. Despite pre-purchasing tickets online, I still had to endure long lines. Once inside, it was frustrating as many visitors monopolized the windows, taking repetitive photos and selfies. The worst part was leaving the observatory deck, which took a painful hour. Sadly, this experience was a letdown, and I have no plans to return in the future.

"The mountain is a beautiful icon of Japan and a place of near pilgrimage for around 5000 people every day during its two month ‘open’ season. Booking of accommodation is essential before you arrive as everything is packed. I came with a mountaineers outlook which was a mistake. Despite the high altitude this mountain is treated more as a tourist activity with marshalling to keep the massive stop/start queue in order for the last kilometre or two to the summit from station 8. The summit has cafes, vending machines, bulldozers and thousands of sunrise photographers when you get there. Some people (mostly Europeans) tried to show off their mountaineering prowess and barge past the queues making the congestion even worse. If you’re after some proper mountaineering head to the Northern Alps. If you want to climb Fuji, do it Japanese style, with helmet, patient queuing and a can of squirty oxygen.",Tripadvisor
"Masificado y si vas para intentar sacar alguna foto decente olvídate. Más tiempo en las colas que intentando ver algo, no sé el motivo de poner horarios si te vas a encontrar cientos de personas, encima varias zonas de la torre con negocios, fotos, cafés...

We came here because my kids thought it would be fun and in fact they would tell you that it was fun. They got to feed the deer and bow to them to make them bow back. The deer have been trained to do this. I hated it. The deer are everywhere and are sickly looking with issues with their fur. A woman on this site wrote that she got deer mites from petting them. Gross. Wish I had read that before visiting. The deer are super aggressive and bang their heads on you. One with shaved horns banged me very hard on my rear end. Not what I want. There is deer crap everywhere so you end up walking in it. Not sanitary. Avoid.,Tripadvisor

"以前一度上った事があり、展望回廊まで上がると3,000円を超える価格設定では躊躇してしまいました。地上から全容を眺めるべくチェックしてみたのですが、直線距離が短くても日中は意外にも目立たないタワーでした。両国の旧安田庭園からも十分確認出来ましたが、目立たないのはその色調が影響しているものと分かりました。因みに羽田空港到着便の機内から撮影した写メにも写っていたのが後から分かりました。",Tripadvisor

"Visited here as part of a tour; unfortunately, it was cloudy and the views were zero, unless you like looking in the clouds. Probably would be better with less overcast.

It can be a big crowd he and the cue to get to the top is a bit hectic. If you’ve been to one of the other tall buildings, I don’t think it be necessary to specifically come here but if you’re in the area, no reason not to stop in.",Tripadvisor

Mount Fuji is about 2 hours outside of Tokyo. We took a local train from Shinjuku station to Otsuki station and then changed to a train to Kawaguchiko station. A lot of people got off at the Mount Fuji station but we had read that it's better to get views from Kawaguchiko.,Tripadvisor

"I was a little underwhelmed by the experience. We went on a sunday, bad choice, because it is very busy on weekends. That said, even though the line was long, it moved fast. The elevator ride is extremely smooth and fast. Less than a minute in length of time, and you really don't notice that you are going up that fast, nor can you see anything as you go up. You get onto the elevator as a group. When you get to the top, it opens up to a view.

Before we went up, I looked up from the base and got vertigo because it is so tall and big. When you get to the top, you really don't notice how high you are unless you try to look down. And you can look down because there is a glass floor on the lower level that you can choose to walk on. I found the actual experience to be quite comfortable and pleasant. Even my wife, who is afraid of heights and was apprehensive about going up, felt comfortable so long as she didn't get close to the windows.

What I was underwhelmed about was the view. Myself not knowing much about Tokyo, I really couldn't appreciate what I was looking at or the view. But the view is great. You can see many kilometers. I do recommend the experience though.",Tripadvisor

"We took a 7am train to Otsuki ( they pronounce it ""Ot-ski) (free with the Japan Rail Pass) and then from there bought the Sakura Easy-Ride Pass to Kawaguchiko (Y2200 each for a 2-day pass- not covered by the JRP) We only used it for one day, though. Anyway, this gives the buyer access to all trains and buses to and from Mt Fuji 5th station. Unfortunately, the 5th station was snowed in, so we had to stop at the 4th station. ---all good, though, there was food to buy, trinkets to buy, and some great views were there. I'm including some pictures.

The station at Otsuki was nice --a convenience shop with great coffee, too! The station attendants were very helpful and polite.

Back on a train, we sat on the right side to get views --which we did.

In Kawaguchiko, we took a bus up to the 4th station, looked around and then returned on one of the many buses lined up there.

We then took another bus - to visit the lake area. Since it was such a cold and drizzly day, we skipped the boat ride and the funicular ride. We walked along the lake , and stopped for a quick Indian lunch,at one place, coffee and cake at another place, and then stopped at another store to buy Mt. Fuji shaped cookies. Then we caught a bus going back to the Kawaguchiko station ---looked around at the gift shop --which has a lot of different things to buy, actually, including green tea ice cream, and then got on the train (5pm?) to start our trip back to Shinjuku.

By train, from Shinjuku to Otsuki station, it's about 70 minutes and from Otsuki to Kawaguchiko, it about 55 minutes. It was a full, but, great day!",Tripadvisor
There were a lot more lines then views as it was too crowded. Super crowded. If I had known it was like this I would not have signed up.,Tripadvisor
Recommend only on a mostly clear sunny day so you can take full advantage of the entire panoramic views. Be sure to reserve your tickets ahead of time to avoid the long lines.

"Ladies and gentlemen, prepare to be transported to the heights of euphoria as we ascend the Tokyo Skytree! As I stood atop its uppermost platform, a dizzying 450 meters above the bustling city below, I found myself immersed in a world of wonder.

The views from this lofty perch were nothing short of spectacular. From up here, Tokyo stretched out beneath me like a sprawling, twinkling carpet of lights. It's a humbling experience that instantly puts our place in this vast world into perspective. You can't help but feel like a tiny speck in the grand tapestry of the universe, a sensation that liberates your very soul.

But let's talk about sunset at the Skytree – a spectacle that turns the cityscape into a canvas of dreams. In the summer months, as the sun descends, it casts a warm, golden glow across the horizon. The clouds above shimmer like spun gold, and their reflections dance gracefully on the tranquil waterways below. It's a moment of pure enchantment that tugs at your heartstrings and leaves you breathless.

And then there's the joy of watching the local traffic winding through the city's arteries far below. It's like peering into a miniature Tokyo, a bustling metropolis transformed into a tiny world of its own.

So, my fellow adventurers, when you find yourself in Tokyo, make sure to ascend to the heavens at the Tokyo Skytree. Let the sweeping views and breathtaking sunsets remind you of the immense beauty of our world and the serenity that can be found in the clouds. It's a journey that will leave you both humbled and exhilarated, a true highlight of any Tokyo adventure!",Tripadvisor
Best way to get out and about in the open air with stunning scenery and to make new friends. This event is well organised. This year coming for sure will be booking this one again.,Tripadvisor
"It was a wonderful and refreshing journey to the mt.Fuji via Subashiri trails. Mt. Fuji located in Honshu prefecture and it is the highest volcano in Japan at 3776-meter height. Normally Climbing season will open for the public from early July to mid of September. During this period usually, the mountain will be free from snow and people can opt which trails they want to use as per their convenience. There are four trails are currently open for the public, first one is Yoshida trails the popular one also comparatively easy to climb if you are beginner, the second one is Subashiri trails, third on is Gothenba and the final one is Fujinomiya trails. You can get public transport from Shinjuku (near Tokyo) to any above-mentioned trails.
Climbing gears like hiking shoes, UV protected sunglasses, waterproof backpack, rain gears and winter wears is must get good experience. You can rent it the same from any above-mentioned trails starting point. We need advance booking for that.",Tripadvisor

"This was an OK visit - perhaps we have simply done too many of these, and before coming were spolied by nighttime views from the Shanghai Tower and the 45th Floor of the Tokyo Municipal Building (the latter which is free to go up) and last Autumn went up the Lote Tower in Seoul. Unless you want to pay extra you only actually go to the viewing deck two thirds up the tower. Overall, OK, but not as good as the Shanghai Tower or the Lotte Tower.",Tripadvisor
Worthwhile for the views of Tokyo. It wasn’t too crowded but there was a bit of a lineup. Probably pair it with the Sensoji temple which is nearby.,Tripadvisor
"After I printed the invoice I realized that kids younger than 6 could go free. They refused to reimburse the money claiming there was no “cancelation policy”. I thought it was dishonest and was a striking contrast from what I experienced in other Japanese attractions visited.
In top of that it was a cloudy day, we couldn’t see anything nor from the Tembo Deck or from the Galleria.",Tripadvisor
"In a great location, was easy to get there, the structure from outside and inside is just magnificent with amazing views of the sprawling city and beyond.

But, the crowd management needs to improve drastically. We booked a slot 7 days in advance but felt it was overcrowded on way up (and not all lifts were running) and the wait and line to take the life down was cramped and not comfortable...they need a better process. The staff did their best.

The coffee shop is small with not much choices and only standing tables. No places to sit and admire the views after the long Line.

Overall, must visit place but suggest booking early morning slots to avoid the crowd.",Tripadvisor

I stayed in the Lake Kawaguchiko area in a hotel with Mount Fuji right in front of the room. It was completely dark and couldn’t see a thing when I arrived. What a pleasant surprise at about 3 am - a pale shape of Mount Fuji began to appear. I walked to the lake outside the hotel at 4 am and there were already a dozen tourists holding their cameras with excitement. The best time for photos is perhaps early in the morning with the reflection of Fuji clearly in the water. The reflection disappears as soon as the sun comes out. I stayed for three days but could have been there for a week. There are many places to visit around Fuji and I am glad that I have been there.,Tripadvisor

We spent a few days at different locations waiting for a clear day to see 3776m Mt Fuji. When we took the Hakone Ropeway (cable cabin) it was cloudy so we wasted our money. Then we went to the Five Lakes and saw Mt Fuji clearly from the Theme Park. Have a roller coaster ride at Green land too!,Tripadvisor
"The Skytree experience is a must-do in Tokyo because it allows you to see Tokyo from the 360 degree gallery over 400meters aboveground. The first bit of advice is to book tickets online or at your hotel as the lines can be looonnggg. The elevator to the Gallery is an experience in itself as the speed in which it gets to the heights is staggering.

Once at the gallery, you can take you time to see all the nooks and crannies of Tokyo and finally see the fabulous way in which it is organized architecturally. Beautiful building, water, bridges. There are a lot of restaurants on the top floors if you want to dine with a view. Plus photo services for professional souvenirs. We did neither but these services seemed very popular. We just looked around, took pictures and enjoyed the perspective.

The big plus for us is around the Skytree there is a mall with lots of activities and an open area outside with food and drinks even beer... so you can literally visit the Skytree and spend the rest of the day hanging out in and around the vicinity. Fun. Fun. Fun.",Tripadvisor
Awesome train journey up to the Mountain . It's like the Harry Potter train. Spectacular views. Well worth a visit.,Tripadvisor

Was stuck at the entrance with young kids due to system error from the vendor. No QR code was issued and was unable to enter.

"This is Japan's tallest structure and the second tallest in Asia. With Tokyo being such a large city, this is a great way to see much of it. Admission is in advance or pay on the day. It is not expensive. Two lifts take you to the top observation deck.

Plenty of shops and refreshment facilities. We were especially lucky to catch the Commer van mobile bar on the terrace.",Tripadvisor
"Going to Tokyo Skytree is an experience that you should highly consider doing, when going to Tokyo. The size of this tower is going to blow your mind once you stand at the foot of it. Yes the ticket price is not that cheap but the view you get of the city is absolutely breathtaking. After taking in the view you can either check out the mall that's at the base of Skytree, or go to the aquarium which is also right at the base of the Tower.
I have been fortunate enough to visit Japan a few times and I always go to Skytree.",Tripadvisor

Pena que o tempo estava nublado, não conseguimos pegar o pôr do sol, mas o outras vistas sobre a paisagem, os rios, as pontes e o ganho de luzes que a cidade vai ganhando foi sensacional;
Subir os 2 estágios da Torre, 350m e 450m super recomendo, dá uma baita diferença na visão;

Pontos de melhoria seria a sky floor, é pequeno, e o espaço poderia ser maior para podermos ter a sensação de fato estar “flutuando”; Mas muito legal tbm;
Valeu muito a experiência!",Tripadvisor
"Tokyo Skytree is one of the most iconic and visible free stranding structure in this Mega city. I always see this magnificent structure towering over the skylines of Tokyo, in particular in Asakusa district whenever we visit the temple and I always tell myself next time I will not just take a photo - I will go up there!!! And indeed it happened, late Spring of 2023 together with my parents finally another one of my bucket list checked!!!

Opened in 2012 with a height of 634m, it was commissioned by Tobu Railway for Broadcasting and Observatory purposes. It is located along the banks of Sumida river and near Asakusa. It was once the tallest Tower in the world and now is still the 3rd tallest. With a Neo-futuristic design of a Tree and made of steel and concrete in a Glorious White colour.

We booked our tickets via Klook for Tembo deck at 350m for around 2K Yen per person. There is an option for Galleria Spiral ramp at 450m which you need an additional 1K Yen but we only booked the former. Getting here you need to go to Tokyo Skytree station via Tobu Skytree Line or Oshiage station via Hanzomon Line. There is an access fron Asakusa station Ginza line to Tobu line but you need to make sure to walk to the right exit of Ginza line and walk to the right path to Tobu line else you will get lost like what happened to us. In the end, we just booked a taxi hehe.

Our ticket was supposed to be at 5 PM so we could see the sunset and night views but we got some unfortunate train delay from Ashikaga that day and we got lost going to Tobu Skytree line causing us to arrive here at almost a quarter past 8 in the evening. We still pushed thru because we have no more time the next day and we arrived at the West entrance. From the entrance we could immediately see its Immaculate Mighty Prowess and Glory, standing high and mighty in a clear dark night, vivid and dazzling with its Warm White tone and changing colours. There is also a very bright beam of light coming from its towering antenna. When we reached the ticketing counter, we approached one of the staff and informed about our late arrival. They were very kind enough to let us in and since we booked via Klook we already have a QR code. The lift to the Tembo deck starts at 4F and it took 30 secs to get there. Its a simple ride with colorful visual lighting effects and traditional folk music that brings you all the way to the top. As you arrived, you will be on the top most floor of the Tembo deck. This deck spans 3 floors and each has its own great and spectacular views of the city. The top has the widest and broadest glass windows. The middle has souvenir shop and the Musashi sky restaurant. The lower has cafe and glass floors which offers a vertical look downward view of the colorful city.

Tokyo is so stunning and dazzling especially on a clear night with all the bright and colorful lights, its thousands of buildings, gently flowing river, bustling roads, incredible towers and other fantastic landmarks. Each spot in this 360 degree indoor observatory has its own unique and amazing views to offers. There are cute and aesthetic labels, signage, logos and cartoons related to Tokyo skytree all across the observatory where you could take your beautiful and special photos and videos. Walking all over the observation deck will take you around a minute that’s how big it is. There are souvenir shops and toilets also located at this floor. We didn’t go to the middle floor but we took an Escalator all the way to the lower floor where the cafe and Glass floor panels are located. The ride via Escalator is around 20 secs and as we go down you will have a wonderful view again of the city skyline at night. We tried the view from glass floor but its a bit short only compared to other towers we visited around 9 secs, however, still worth a try!!!

After almost an hour of breathtaking experience, its almost few mins past 9 in the evening we decided to call it a night and bid our adieu to this aesthetic engineering marvel!!! Next time we would definitely try the Tembo Galleria so we could try the world’s highest Skywalk and of course during sunset so we could view a different perspective of Tokyo during this time. Tembo Galleria is famous for its spiral ramp which sounds pretty exciting so we would try it next time!!! We took a couple of photos and videos from the worm’s angle down outside the tower before heading our way back to our hotel and this time its colours have changed to elegant Purple.

Tokyo Skytree is indeed a must visit attraction if you’re visiting Tokyo and loves high and mighty Towers and Observation decks just like me then look no further - Tokyo Skytree is definitely one of the best and must try out because it is the Eye of this wonderful city!!! See you soon Tokyo Skytree!!! Matah Neh :=)",Tripadvisor
"The observation and wait times were extremely manageable on my visit… the view was remarkable and the offering of both drinks, friendly staff, air conditioning and general opportunity to witness Tokyo 360 degrees was great….

It was however, just another observation encounter that for some can be a little overrated in its own right.

If you want to look from above and witness the views, it’s a 5 star process.. was easier to navigate than Shibuya Sky…

The glass floor was interesting…. Also, on arrival, if you are going to the 450 point - on the second elevator be ready to film the roof as it is glass and you can witness the top of the tower as you get closer to it…

Overall was enjoyable, would be nice if you could smell the air though :)",Tripadvisor
"Increíbles vistas de Tokio, compramos el ticket para ambos niveles y valió mucho la pena. El piso superior es espectacular con unas vistas y puntos fotográficos increíbles. Una visita obligada en Tokio para quienes sean amantes de las vistas panoramicas y en altura. Es plata muy bien invertida, además todo el centro comercial que se encuentra en donde esta la torre es bellísimo y tiene una terraza verde preciosa para descansar un rato al aire libre mirando la torre.",Tripadvisor

"I ended up in this area by accident really. I didn’t do my research well enough to realize that this is an hour away from the main tourist areas in Kyoto (Gion). And how glad I was to have found it! This area is by far the highlight of my trip to Japan. It’s not as crowded, has absolutely serene atmosphere, amazing food, traditional ryokans of the finest quality, temples, zen gardens, bamboo forest, kimono forest, monkeys, etc.
It’s a relatively small area, but very cozy. Most of the places are walking distance and close to each other. I spent here one night and one day, but two days would be better.
The main strip area has lots of shops and restaurants, animal cafes, even a spa. They really go overboard here in desert presentations. I thoroughly enjoyed this area! Definitely worth a trip!",Tripadvisor
Delusione totale..abbiamo visto boschetti di bamboo molto più belli in contesti molto meno caotici!! Molto interessante è invece pagare un biglietto abbastanza costoso per entrare nella proprietà della star del film samurai Okochi Denjiro ....Il ricco attore seguace dello Zen ha lavorato 30 anni per costruire uno straordinario giardino che si estende sul panorama di Kyoto... compreso nel biglietto ol migliore te' matcha bevuto in Giappone..,Tripadvisor
"The huge bamboos are stunning but it is a shame that you are not free to walk amongst them, but only on a predetermined path (which is shorter than expected).
Well worth the visit if visiting the adjacent Tenryu-ji Temple gardens first and the film actor's home afterwards (expensive but also beautiful gardens)",Tripadvisor
"My husband and I were in Japan for our honeymoon and spent one night near Lake Kawaguchi in order to get the famous Mt. Fuji view. We actually hadn't planned what to do in the town itself, and decided to check out the Itchiku Kubota museum the day of as we were wandering around the town googling what to do. What a genuinely delightful and actually quite moving surprise this museum was! It was a bit of a pain to get to, we had to walk to the edge of town and then up a mountain road for several minutes before we found the entryway (which is quite mystical in and of itself, a beautiful stone doorway leading onto a forest path, ooh!). Itchiku Kubota was a textile artist who hand-dyed silk kimono, with each kimono sometimes taking up to a year to make! When we got to the museum we were invited to watch a video about the artist, which was about half an hour long. In the main hall they had almost 30 of his kimono on display, and they were really stunning to see up close. It was beautiful hearing him talk in the video about his passion for his work before seeing them. After looking at the kimono, we walked around the grounds of the museum, which is a beautiful forest dotted with strange little doorways, stone benches and chairs, ponds, mossy stumps, and a little grotto with a few stone sculptures. It's quite magical. I am very thankful that we stumbled upon such a beautiful little place, and I am grateful that I now know of Kubota's beautiful and inspiring artwork!",Tripadvisor
"From Kyoto Station, we took the JR line to Sago Arashimaya Station and walked to Togetsukyo Bridge On the way to this bridge, there are many traditional Japanese buildings which house eating stalls, souvenir shops and snack outlets. There are also shops renting out Japanese kimono dress. So you get to see a lot of tourists wearing the kimonos.
The wooden bridge spans the Katsura River in front of Arashimaya Mountain. The scenery is not so spectacular in winter as most of the flowers and leaves have withered. It must be very beautiful during spring or autumn when the cherry blossoms. According to Dr Google, there are a lot of koi fish living in the river. But we didn’t notice any during our visit!
Then we proceeded to Tenryu-ji Temple This temple is one of the most important temple in Kyoto’s Arashimaya District. The temple was built in 1339 by the ruling shogun Ashikaga Takauji. It was ranked first among the city’s five great zen temples. The garden surrounding it also has very beautiful landscaping. We walked around the compound before proceeding to our main highlight that is Arashimaya bamboo grove. This is Kyoto’s top sights for tourists. It is one of the most beautiful and most serene places in Kyoto. The tall green bamboo trunk which sways gently stretches towards the sky giving you a feeling of tranquility. The atmosphere is so calm and tranquil. Know what? It is a natural forest. For most tourists, they might think that it is man-grown grove. At this grove, there are many man pulled carts allowing those tourists who prefer to enjoy the scenery comfortably sitting on the cart. There‘s even the Sagano Romantic train to take you to various parts of Saga-Arashimaya area of western Kyoto including the bamboo forest! For your information, if you want to save time, join a local tour will be good option. This will help you to avoid running around searching for the places you want to visit!",Tripadvisor
"Tokyo Skytree is a really cool tower with a massive shopping mall, awesome food, and a super awesome view of the city. It's beautifully decorated too.",Tripadvisor
"First thing to do is buy tickets - either online or at the booth.

If going to the 450m, after buying ticket you get sent to a waiting area, for your time. You have to walk out of the building and back in by the ticket buying entrance to get to your elevator - a bit of a muck around actually.

Going up is fast, you first land at the lower deck, check it out and then go on another elevator to the Tembo deck.
Great views from there.

We were at a low peak time. This would be a pain if it was peak time such as evening or a weekend.

A neat site to visit but just a much around getting up to it.",Tripadvisor
"Tokyo Sky tree offers breathtaking panoramic views of the city. Its observation decks provide a unique perspective, especially at sunset. A must visit landmark.",Tripadvisor
"If you want to get a grasp of the sheer size of Tokyo then going up the Skytree is the best way to do so. With a bit of luck, one can even see Mt. Fuji. But even on a hazy day, the views are amazing.",Tripadvisor
"Nous avons déjà fait des points de vue plus centraux (Mori Tower, Mudtown, Tokyo Tower) par le passé, Skytree était donc une évidence pour nous et nous n'avons pas été déçus du point de vue exceptionnel dans son étendue. Il faut juste avoir à l'esprit qu'il est assez éloigné du centre et qu'on voit mal ce dernier par rapport aux autres lieux que j'ai cités. A prendre en compte dans sa programmation. Je conseillerais sur une première visite avec pas assez de temps pour caser deux observatoires de la laisser de côté même si encore une fois j'ai adoré.
Réservations bien gérées avec une attente raisonnable.",Tripadvisor
"I have read many positive reviews so I had a high expectation. We went with a tour group from Tokyo, it's about 2.5 hrs drive one way. The stay was really short from the tour. It was a sunny day with some clouds, but the peak was frequently covered. So we actually only had glimpses of the peak. When we could see it, it certainly looks spectacular. It was a little disappointing that the pictures we took did not come out well. According to our guide, the tour from the previous day couldn't see anything since it was a cloudy day. So my advice is to definitely check the weather before going.",Tripadvisor
"Smuk udsigt over Tokyo vi var der om aftenen.
Vi havde bestilt billetter til øverst også.
Man kunne godt se at man kom højere op, men der er en super fin udsigt på 1 dæk. Man får ikke meget ekstra ved at komme helt op. Spar de sidste penge",Tripadvisor
"Der Tokyo Skytree ist eine schöne Sehenswürdigkeit, bei uns war jedoch sehr viel los. Die Aussicht war aber schön, wir haben die Top Deck Tour gemacht.",Tripadvisor
"Wir haben morgens als das Wetter stimmte online vorreserviert. Den Eingang für den Skytree zu finden, benötigt etwas Zeit. Vor Ort mussten wir unser online Ticket in ein Papier Ticket eintauschen ( Dauer 1 Min.) Und könnten uns dann einreihen, um hinauf zu fahren (ca. 3-6 Minuten Wartezeit)
Anders als andere haben wir keine Aufenthaltsdauer bekommen. Wir haben uns mehrere Stunden dort aufgehalten. Es kann gespeist oder Kaffee getrunken werden. Es gibt sogar einen Shop.
Zum Sonnenuntergang wird der Turm natürlich voller. Hat man ein Ticket für die Gallerie kann man nur einmal hinauf fahren, fährt man wieder aufs Tembo-Deck zurück, ist das Gallerie-Ticket verfallen. Aber darauf wird man hingewiesen.
Spiegelungen sind bis auf eine Reklame-Tafel am höchsten Punkt eigentlich kein Problem.
Wir sind gegen 21 Uhr wieder heruntergefahren. Da zu dieser Zeir viele runterfahren wollten, mussten wir ins etwa 10 Minuten warten.",Tripadvisor
"We had a lucky break only in the morning when the clouds cleared and we had a clear view of Mount Fuji on the 5th level. The rest of the day there were clouds covering the peak. Lakes were beautiful.

Will definitely visit again if we are back in Tokyo.",Tripadvisor
"To see the sheer expanse of Tokyo, this tower is a must. Like any other skyscraper but the views of Tokyo on a clear day are fantastic. Must visit.",Tripadvisor
"Wow, we booked for the “Sunset” time…arrived around 6pm, and stayed till 8pm. It was very very busy…but the view of the city was outstanding. Crowds behaved well, you just have to be patient. No view of Fuji today, but that’s normal. Sunset view spectacular, but get to that side early and wait. Food market outside of Tower looked great and was very busy..but I don’t know it that there all the time.
Do the SKYTREE early on in your visit to Tokyo, to get your bearings.",Tripadvisor
Skytree admission and entering was pretty fast and easy to find when coming in with the subway. The wiews were great as expected.,Tripadvisor
"Im Grunde sind alle Aussichtstürme und berühmten, hohen Gebäude auf der ganzen Welt identisch. Was möchte man? Mehr oder weniger die Aussicht mit Ruhe und ohne große Hindernisse und Spiegelungen genießen.

Kurz: all das geht auf dem Skytree leider nicht. Selbst mit vorgebuchten Karten ist der Ablauf zäh, alles sehr eng, wegen der vielen nicht-Japaner extrem laut.

Bin oben angekommen, quasi gleich wieder runter gefahren. Die Reise zurück auf den Erdboden hat rund 40-45 Minuten gedauert geerdet war ich früher. Schade.

Zeitfenster 20:00",Tripadvisor

My second visit. I like it. But too rush as with tour. Would prefer to go on our own the next time and hike up the mountain.,Tripadvisor
"We booked online and got the ticket with both viewing decks. The view from the 450m deck wasn't worth the extra money or queue for the lift, The structure of the deck obscures the view. The view from the regular deck was much better, although it was a more crowded area. We didn't see Fuji but had a decent albeit hazy view over Tokyo. The glass floor was very underwhelming. We preferred the government building observation deck - it's free and much less crowded, and you still get a great view.",Tripadvisor

grasp of English and had a great sense of houmour. he was Knowledgeable of points of interest along the way and the history.on the way to Mt Fuji you stop off at several villages on the way and as this was our first full day in japan .you get to have your first taste of Japanese food.and if you are lucky like we were you get to go to stage 5 the point where climbers of Mt Fuji start and get the best positions for photographs of Mt Fuji.",Tripadvisor
Overrated experience. The galleria and deck did not have many amenities. The glass floor is only 2 square meters. It looked more like a WE R! museum (I guess it is a j-pop group) than an actual japanese tower.,Tripadvisor
"We got a last minute ticket for 5.30 on the same day. Queued a while to get in and then squished in an elevator to go up. Unfortunately just missed sunset but it wouldn't have mattered because it was so busy that you could barely look out the windows on any level. 2 person thick at each window. Made trying to view anything particular impossible. We went to the higher level hoping it might quieten down but very busy still.

Not a single seat/chair on either floor to sit down on, either to rest or just enjoy the view. I was feeling a bit dizzy so sat on the floor at the wall but was told to get up

Then trying to leave was an effort: a queue of 100s of people snaking around the lower level waiting for the elevator. Took over 30 mins just to get into one

All in all, I wouldn't recommend and hope one of the other observation decks is better equipped",Tripadvisor
"Don’t waste time or money. Nothing great to see, over crowded, waste of time and money. Even with advanced ticket reservations, it was NOT worth the visit.",Tripadvisor
"Our of all the things we did in the great city of Tokyo, this was the most disappointing. Lots of waiting, the exit was a clump of people. Not well organized. More than 40 minutes to get down from the lower deck. Cloudy makes it worse. Not a good value.",Tripadvisor
"If you like the Tiger Balm Gardens in Hong Kong, you'll probably like this place as well. The Grounds and Museum are a paradox, the grounds and buildings are a pastiche of Home made/decorated concrete abstractions which on first encounter make you wonder why you came. However, persist. Resist the urge to go straight into the main exhibition hall, rather, take the time to watch the short video in the ante room which profiles the artist and his motivation. Once you enter the Museum exhibition hall proper you are presented with an amazingly wonderful display of the artist's unique talent. Sit on a bench and try to absorb the detail and effort that went into the production of these amazing Kiminos. No photography is permitted in the main hall. Visit the artist's quarters and marvel at the inspiring view. (photos allowed here.) There is a second building/shop higher up the hill, which I declined to visit. On leaving, ensure you pause and take in the spectacular view of Mt Fuji across Lake Kawaguchi. A free Car park is adjacent to the entrance.",Tripadvisor
"The mount Fuji is the second highest mountain in Asia. The appearence of this mountain is unbelievably symmetrical and the top is always covered by ice throughout the year. You may wonder about the longivity of japanese people, the secrete is the mighty mount Fuji. The mount Fuji will heal you from inside. It’s a healer!",Tripadvisor
"Uma vista espetacular de toda Tokyo.
A torre é muito alta e está no meio da cidade.
Você consegue ver muitas coisas de lá.
São dois tipos de ingresso: um pra ver o andar 350 e o outro que também dá acesso ao 450.
Visitei só o mais baixo e já vale muito a pena.
Tem um pedaço de chão de vidro pra andar e tirar fotos.
Estive tambem no predio da Prefeitura, que tem entrada gratuita, mas a vista da torre é muito melhor.",Tripadvisor
"The overall experience was a negative one for me. The view is of course spectacular but the effort taken to see it and then get back down was ridiculous. First of all I had prebooked tickets and was told when I arrived early that I would have to wait for my scheduled time. Fair enough, but the queue seemed to get longer and longer and there was no system to stagger walk-ins who had not prebooked. Essentially I'd have been better off walking in and going straight to the queue. Then only one lift was operating, so I never made my scheduled time anyway as I was stuck in the slowly moving queue which had been bulked out by walk ins. If only the prebooked tickets had been allowed to go up the process would have been much quicker and I'd have gone up for the time I'd booked. Getting down was even worse. Again only one lift was operating and the queue to get into it snaked around the viewing platform. Hundreds of people including families with young children or the elderly stood in line for over 90 minutes until at last another lift became available. There was no clear reason for this and having a system whereby families with young children could be fast tracked would have seemed sensible. This is obviously a regular occurrence as evidenced by the pre-prepared laminated sheets of A4 held up by staff telling us there were delays. So 1 hour to get up and 2 to get down. I was unable to make my next appointment and lost money and to make matters worse it has been impossible to contact customer services by email. I have found a phone number but I'm back home now and really don't wish to telephone a number in Japan that uses a translation service and may well cost me a lot of money. Bottom line: if you love far reaching views then by all means go, but I wouldn't bother with a prebooked timed ticket as it seems you'll be okay just rocking up on the day. And don't have anything planned for at least two hours after you think you might be finished because you'll be there for longer than you thought",Tripadvisor
"We had the foresight to book this before we left home. Worth checking the weather ahead of time if you can, as the idea is to get as good a day as poss.

Just as well we pre booked as it appeared sold out on the day. The place was mobbed, queues everywhere: to get in, to print tickets, for buy tickets (or not), for the lifts, it really was heaving.

The organisation was ok, but the people numbers made it a challenge. We made it up amongst the masses, and you can’t fault the views, although we didn’t really get the sunset we were hoping for, due to an overcast dusk.

At times it felt like we were having to elbow people out of the way to get to the window, but when we did, and as darkness fell, the views were good.

We went to both viewing decks, queuing to get the lift up to the next platform, down to a lower level, to walk over the glass floor and finally down to ground again. I was all queued out by then.

There were virtually no places to sit, which after all the standing around would have been welcome. When you get to ground level again, there are shops, eateries and seats - phew!

I would recommend a visit, but be ready for the busyness and crowds.",Tripadvisor
"... mais pas besoin d'aller à l'étage le plus élevé ! En fait l'étage le plus élevé a des vitres très courbées donc on voit moins bien et il est difficile de prendre des photos. L'étage ""normal"" est suffisant.

Quelle vue en tt cas ! On a meme pu recevoir le Mont Fuji !!! A faire comme activité quand on est sur Tokyo !",Tripadvisor
There were long queues to get in but ways moving due to the 3 large and spacious lifts going up only. It was rather misty so we couldn't see any mountains but great view of the city. We avoided the see through floor looking down on the miniature people below even if the kids weren’t jumping up and down on it. Coming down on esculators and a lift was a little more difficult.,Tripadvisor
"J'avais fait les autres points de vue de Tokyo les années passés mais jamais le SkyTree. Expérience agréable pour voir Tokyo de l'autre côté et avoir une meilleure vue sur la partie baie du sud.
Prenez vos billets à l'avance car il y a beaucoup de monde. Faite attention de venir à votre tranche horaire (nous sommes arrivés 1h plus tot et on nous a refusé l'accés, ce qui n'est pas bien grave car le centre commercial est sympa pour se balader et le quartier autour agréable).
Staff super gentil comme d'habitude.
Un peu cher mais c'est Tokyo.",Tripadvisor
"Although I read here in Tripadvisor that it’s waist of money to buy for both decks, I bought tickets for both the Tembo deck and the galleria, and guess what? It’s a waist of money! Beside of the nice effect in the elevator between the two decks, the view from the galleria seemed the same as the one from the deck, so not really worth paying for the extra view. Also, be careful they tell you can come back to the lower deck after visiting the lower – you are not coming to the same area but to a much more limited area for viewing the scenery. And yes, we booked for sunset – recommended. All was pretty good organized. The views are great but overall, not much of an experience. The building is much more impressing from the outside. There is also a nearby nice shopping mall with restaurants and shops.",Tripadvisor
"Took the elevator up the Toyko Skytree, what fantastic views of the city. Toyko is massive and stretches on for ever. If you have never been up a tall building this is a must as the first time you see a city from this height is breat taking.
Only a little issue is the gift shop, it lacks any real merch, lots of sweets and over priced cheep tack",Tripadvisor

入場料が高く、休日の当日券だと大人3400円。ちょっと躊躇しますが行って良かったです。前売り券があるようなので行くことが決まっている人はうまく活用すると良いです。

"Went to Skytree and was pleasantly surprised how they got people up to the viewing platform so fast. I was told there are about 300 shops to view before you go up to level 4 to purchase out tickets .. We had a fair size line up but moved quickly.. The lifts up were fast and had a great display above the doors . Worth paying the extra to go to the top level.
Panoramic views at the top make this visit worth while..",Tripadvisor

"Climbing Mount Fuji is an excellent experience. Make sure that you stay in a mountain hut as climbing the entire mountain in one-shot will be exhausting. Remember to bring warm clothes for the summit as it is very cold up there. We were not prepared and we suffered for it as we were waiting for the sunrise. Also, try to bring a minimal amount of garbage as there is nowhere to throw it out from the 5th station onwards. Furthermore, you can rent all the equipment you need from the 5th station. It is much cheaper to go by yourself than with a tour group and you can set your own pace. It is an experience of a lifetime and you won't regret it.",Tripadvisor

"We actually went twice. Ince during daytime and once during sunset.

I recommend spenden aprx. an hour and if possible to get both experiences with a single ticket.

The First observation deck is gratis, but can be very crowded. I do not recommend getting the ticket for the second observation deck, as the view is actually slightly less good due to smaller Windows and more steel blockiert the view. Instead I would go to another platform as the Mori Tower in Roppongi, which has an even better view as the skytree overall (personal opinion). Thus, if you have enough time, both are worth a visit.",Tripadvisor

東京スカイツリーは圧巻でした！どこまでも広がる東京の街並みを、あんな高さから眺められるなんて感動的！地上階の展示では日本の伝統文化についても学べ、充実した時間を過ごせました。レストランやカフェもあるので、景色を楽しみながらゆっくり食事もできますね。昼間の風景も素晴らしいですが、ライトアップされた夜景はロマンチック！カップルにもおすすめです。,Tripadvisor
"Great place to visit, be sure that you venture further than just the main area. We met up with a large group of school children wanting to practice their English it was awesome to interact with them. As others noted some of the deer cab be pushy if you have crackers. This is a must visit",Tripadvisor
"Osaka Castle is located in a beautiful park. The approach to the castle is beautiful and inside is even better. Tickets are really cheap, like around 6USD I think (December 2023). Be prepared for a bit of stair climbing. There's an elevator that will take you to the 5th level, but there are attractions on all levels 2-8. So if you have any hesitancy about walking up 8 flights, take the elevator to 5, see the exhibits on the upper floors, including the observation deck, which gives you a beautiful 360 degree view of Osaka, then walk down to each level, looking at the exhibits along the way to the ground floor.",Tripadvisor
"We came on Dec 8, 2023 for the koyo and we did see stunning colors of yellow, red, orange and brown. Many trees had become deciduous and covered the ground with colorful leaves. There are several trees that were cheering red. Nara is absolutely one of the best places to watch koyo. Nara Park is just about 5 min walk from Kinetsu Station. It's home to many roaming deer, which are regarded as God's messengers. It's OK to feed them with rice crackers as some stores sell them for 200yen. Refrain from touching the deer as they are still wild and unpredictable animals. Avoid teasing them with food as they can get so aggressive and may bite you.",Tripadvisor
un temple à ne pas rater dans la visite de cette monumentale ville qu'est Tokyo. Sorte de grouillements permanents de gens qui se croisent devant les petits commerces de souvenirs. Idéal pour faire des achats de dernière minute. Très beau temple imposant et reposant,Tripadvisor

"Tempio enorme nel centro di Tokyo, ovviamente molto affollato ma vale la pena di visitarlo ed immergersi nella cultura giapponese",Tripadvisor
"Beautiful spot, the shopping street surrounding is great too. The younger teens were a bit meh about the climb but it isn't hard. We went twice once in the afternoon and once first thing in the morning. I definitely recommend the second option as you will avoid the crowds. If you go around 8am you'll catch the shops too.",Tripadvisor

"I took the City Bus # 206 from Stop D2 at the Kyoto Station to reach this attraction. The line of passengers wanting to board was long. Along the way, local Japanese students got on and off this bus.

It was a short walk from the Kiyomizui Bus Stop to the entrance of this attraction. The street is uphill, quite narrow. Both sides of the street have shops, stores, snack bars, selling their stuffs.

The short walk took time because of the number of people walking the tiny street. Taking photos was also difficult. Most visitors, during my visit, were Japanese students on their field trip.

There are 2 colorful temples (bright orange) at the end of the street. There are steps to climb to get closer to these temples. From here, one can see the downtown area of Kyoto and the Kyoto Tower. Took some photos here and hurriedlly left to escape the crowd.",Tripadvisor

"I’ve been to my fair-share of Buddhist temples, and this place is certainly beautiful architecturally so it makes for some great pictures. However, the market street leading up to it and the temple itself is far too busy with tourists that it really takes away from the religious significance. I’m glad I visited to see it, but would not sure I would recommend it for everyone.",Tripadvisor

è il complesso templare buddista più antico della città; si cammina molto e si fanno molte scale come in tutti i templi giapponesi.,Tripadvisor
This is another world heritage site in Kyoto. It was super crowded as some Sakura flowers were budding. Highly recommended to go up to the shrine to admire the beautiful sight of Kyoto.,Tripadvisor
"Generally it is a nice looking shrine, but the crowds of people are immense. Basically you have to push yourself through all those masses and all the booths selling all sort of stuff take away from the mythical touch that I usually get from those places.
We visited the Miyagi and Yamagata prefectures before and we saw similarly impresdive buildings there that were far from being that crowded.
But if you are only in Tokyo, it surely is a place to visit.",Tripadvisor
"数年ぶりに浅草を訪れました。浅草、そして浅草の中心である浅草寺は、以前から、外国人に人気の場所でしたが、コロナが空けてインバウンドが戻ってきた現在は、さらに外国人の姿ばかりが目に付くようになりましたね。
　特に、雷門の周辺は、通るだけでも支障をきたすほどの人込みでした。その込み具合は、仲見世通りに入っても続いていて、浅草寺の宝蔵門を過ぎるまでその状態でした。浅草をのんびり見て歩くことは、これからはなかなかかなわないのかもしれませんね。",Tripadvisor

Oldest temple/shrine but too many tourists. Completely overloaded. I would rather recommend to go to Meiji Jingu with less tourists and a nice parc/forest.,Tripadvisor
It's good place to buy some souvenirs. Especially for charms and protections. but REALLY CROWDED when we got there. (around 12-1pm) Probably need to go earlier to avoid the heavy crowd. There's a place here where you can get your luck based on sticks for the year. I got normal luck. lol!,Tripadvisor

"Fue nuestro primer templo. Fuimos a primera hora y lo vimos muy a gusto. Otro día volvimos por la tarde y no se podía pasar de tanta gente.
Tiene todos lo elementos que se van haciendo familiares. Una gran puerta, una calle con un montón de puestos, un templo con varios edificios y un pagoda.
Tiene una zona de jardines con unos ginkgo impresionantes.
Cerca de la puerta hay un centro de información con una terraza con bonitas vistas.",Tripadvisor
"Senso-ji Temple is an experience. The well-embellished gate, the shopping street leading up to the shrine & the greenery surrounding the temple all add to the lure of the place.",Tripadvisor
"In una settimana a Tokyo, di templi ne ho visti un buon numero. Fra cui tutti quelli più noti e consigliati. Senso-ji è certamente fra i più belli, per struttura, imponenza, colori, fascino. Se giudicarlo il più bello, non saprei. Di sicuro, è quello che ho trovato più affollato di visitatori, sia turisti (innumerevoli), sia pellegrini: il che può costituire un problema quando si vorrebbe esprimere un parere, perché la folla che a malapena ti permette di muoverti ti vieta la concentrazione. Invidio chi sa alzarsi di buon mattino e riesce a concedersi un'esperienza più autentica.",Tripadvisor
"The whole reason to go to Asakusa is to come here, and its well worth it though extremely (like, extremely) crowded. It is the oldest Buddhist temple in Tokyo, having survived the fires of the Great Kanto Earthquake in 1923 only to be destroyed during the bombing raids of WWII and subsequently rebuilt. It is massive and visually striking and clearly the anchor around which the neighborhood was built. You basically have to see it in conjuction with Kaminarimon gate at the end of Nakamise-dori street. The wider temple grounds (the pagoda, the smaller shrines) are also well worth exploring, beyond the temple. Do go up the steps of the temple and look down Nakamise-dori to Kaminarimon at the other end because the view - including the mass of people - is pretty impressive. Senso-ji is elaborate, ornate, packed with people, and loud. In that sense, it also serves as a great contrast with Meiji-jingu (the massive Shinto shrine/temple in Shibuya on the other side of the city, which is austere, quiet and solemn, sitting within a forest of trees).",Tripadvisor
"Breathtaking and awe inspiring. If you're after the traditional Japanese experience and beauty, come here. I recommend just getting lost and strolling around here. There were engaged couples coming here in their traditional Japanese dress and take pictures, which is amazing too.
The culture, the vibrant colours, the water coming out of the statue fountains. Like I said, just get there if you can, and stare at everything, as it's all beautiful. Do check the map as well so you don't miss out on anything (like the gardens with Karp Koi fish in the river), as it's not just the giant temple.",Tripadvisor
"Senso-ji Temple is the oldest Buddhist Temple and is located near Asakusa metro Station.

I learnt how to take the subway from our tour coordinator. Do not buy the JR pass just buy the tourist subway pass. The tourist subway pass costs 600 yen about S$6/- and you can use the pass to take unlimited trips within the twenty four hours around Tokyo.

For example, if you buy the pass at 3 pm, you can use it till 3 pm on the following day. If you did not buy the tourist pass, a single trip pass to Asakusa station via the Ginza line would cost you 260 yen. The return trip would add another 260 which amounted to 520 yen. If you decided to travel to Ueno to visit the museums, you would need to buy another 260 yen tickets, it then added another 260 in the cost. With the tourist metro day pass, you only need to pay 600 yen for unlimited travels.

We purchased the tourist passes and our guide gives us a copy of the metro map. From Kasai station where our hotel is located, we took the blue line to Nihombashi station and changed to the yellow line (Ginza line) which took us to Asakusa station at the last stop.

The Senso-ji Temple is a symbol of Tokyo. If we did not come here, we are like never travelled to Tokyo. It is a blessing we came. While the shopping alley at Nikamise Street appears touristy and commercialised, the temple impresses me as a must visit pilgrimage center for everyone.

It was very crowded and I noticed a number of visitors attired in kimono visited the temple. The kimono and the temple blended very well with the exquisite architecture designs of the Buddhist Temple.

Japan is special, the heritage is well preserved and the Buddhist history is etched in her life story.",Tripadvisor
"Malgré l'effervescence et la foule, c’est un temple à voir avec la pagode à côté. Le quartier d’Asakusa est charmant, suranné comme on aime. Ça change agréablement des buildings modernes. Bon évidemment, avec toutes les échoppes, cela a un côté très mercantile très foirfouille mais on peut avoir de belles surprises comme de beaux masques en bois mais un chouia cher.",Tripadvisor

"Site exceptionnel et d'une beauté extraordiaire. Le temple est accessible facilement en marchant à partir de la gare d'autobus. L""allée pour s'y rendre est magnifique et parsemée de boutiques et de restaurants intéressants. L'architecture typiquement japonaise des édifices près du temple est splendide. En entrant dans l'enceinte du temple on ressent immédiatement un état de relaxation et d'apesanteur. A voir sans faute lors de votre visite à Nagano",Tripadvisor
乘坐公交车到清水寺站下车，跟着人流往上走，大概上午10点，人太多了，或许早上来早，人会比较少。一路有很多精致小店值得一逛，别担心景区的小店是对游客开放，很多都是百年老店，也别担心被宰，日本都是诚信经营，如果时间多就来吧，来之前记得先了解历史，这样会有很深的理解,Tripadvisor

"This is one of the most memorable temples we visited in Japan, perched on the side of a hill with remarkable views of the city. Its a UNESCO World Heritage site and absolutely stunning in its architecture and location, as is the temple gate leading into grounds. The temple grounds are also home to a number of other pagoda and shrines and connect to view points and hiking paths. Its quite crowded with both tourists and worshippers and you should make sure you aren't getting in the way of people's prayers. Along with Nijo-ji, Fushimi Inari, and Kinkaku-ji is probably one of the places you should make an effort to see in Kyoto.",Tripadvisor
เป็นวัดดังของญี่ปุ่น ถ้าหากไม่มาจะถือว่ามาไม่ถึงญี่ปุ่นครับ (หากมาครั้งแรก) วัดดนี้หน้าทางเข้าจะมีถนนคนเดิน ไว้ซื้อของกินและของฝาก ตัววัดใหญ่ คนเยอะ ไม่เสียค่าใช้จ่ายในการเข้า สามารมาไหว้พระขอพรกันได้ที่นี่ครับ,Tripadvisor
"Iconic pagoda and buildings at the front, but if you take a picture here and leave, you're missing out. Pay the 500 yen for the temple and walk around the hillside, you get some amazing views of both Kyoto town, but also the temple buildings from different and pleasing angles. There's nowhere to eat or drink here with it being a spiritual place, but with the price even for a short look say the views.

Important: this place gets really busy, not only with tourists but with school groups, get here early, certainly before 8am",Tripadvisor

"Super impressive temple to visit, very easy to get to, the scale of this temple is amazing with just not the main temple but also surrounding areas with other temples, gardens, cemetery, gold fish and lots more.

A Must Do while in Tokyo.",Tripadvisor
"A prescindere dalla folla dei turisti - di cui comunque ero parte integrante -, che rende sempre più difficile godere con la dovuta tranquillità dei luoghi che si visitano, specialmente quando si tratta di siti religiosi che dovrebbero ispirare sensazioni particolari che il vocio e la calca rendono difficoltose, il Kiyomizu-dera è senza dubbio una delle attrazioni più notevoli di una città che pure ne ha moltissime. La sala Zuigu, con la cavità completamente oscura in cui si procede avvinghiandosi al grande rosario-fune che segue dall'inizio alla fine la parte, fino al punto in cui improvvisamente appare la luce della roccia tonda levigata che va fatta girare esprimendo un desiderio, offre un'esperienza unica. Così come notevoli sono gli interni delle sale del tempio maggiore e la veduta a strapiombo sulla foresta che circonda il complesso.",Tripadvisor
"A must-see in Tokyo - Senso-Ji and its surrounding area is a sight to behold. Because of this though you can expect it to be quite busy when visiting, but even with crowds it is well worth it. Before or after visiting the shrine you can buy food from the surrounding stalls. It is easy to get to as the metro station is right next door.",Tripadvisor
"We only had 1 day in Tokyo and I decided to choose this temple due to its convenient location. Lots of tourists like us taking pics at the Kaminarimon gate.

Senso-ji temple is the most prominent shrine in Tokyo that you must visit if you are in Tokyo. Lot of options for shopping and street food around temple campus. It becomes crowded in evening and hence you need to factor some time if you are visiting this place.,Tripadvisor
"It is the most widely visited religious site in the world, with over 30 million visitors annually. And guess what? It was BUSY! We decided to check out the shops along the Nakamise-dōri, and even though it was one of the busiest places we walked through, most people were so polite, and it didn’t bother us.

Once we approached the temple, there were o-mikuji stalls. For a suggested donation of 100 yen (65 cents), visitors can consult the oracle and divine answers to their questions. Guests shake labeled sticks from enclosed metal containers and read the corresponding answers they retrieve from one of 100 possible drawers. Omikuji are always fun to get when visiting a temple; for those who cannot read Japanese, the staff or Google Lens can help by telling you if you received a good (大吉) or bad (大凶) fortune.

If it’s good, you keep it. If not, you can tie the fortune to a tree branch near or outside the reception area and leave your bad luck behind.

Overall, this temple was incredibly crowded, so we enjoyed walking the streets around it but didn't stay on the grounds for long. From here, we did find some nice views of Tokyo Skytree.",Tripadvisor

Arrived there at 05:45 am, thanks to a terrible jet-lag. Completly alone, saw the sunrise behind skytree illuminate the pagoda, and shimmer through all the red and gold of the temples and shrines. Truly a remarkable religious experience. I advise arriving before the 06:00 am service at Senso-ji, and enjoy the silence before the explosion of chants and drums of the morning prayers... Also not to be missed the 06:00 am bell, once heard also by the poet Basho in old Edo times.",Tripadvisor
"I would love to give this five stars but again, the crowds made it difficult to enjoy parts of this experience. It's a really beautiful place with a nice five story pagoda, and the main hall on stilts is very impressive. There is a nice walk to a small pagoda where people pray for fertility. The main hall and the views of the main hall with Kyoto in the background were the most crowded areas. It is definitely worth visiting but probably best to go as early as possible.",Tripadvisor

確かに建物や観光名所としてはとても素晴らしい日本の代表する名所です。それだけにとても衝撃でショックで恥ずかしく思いました。それは世界で一番美しいはずのトイレがゴミで溢れかえり、とても汚く入ることさえ躊躇するくらい汚れた浅草寺のトイレ。トイレには綺麗なトイレを心がけています。何かお気づきのときは警備員室まで。と貼紙がありました。この現状知らないのかと思い伝えに行きました。そしたら、、週末はいつもそうなんですよ。係が休みだと間に合わないんですよ～。色んな人が使いますからね～って。。鼻で笑われた感。。余計驚きました。前からそうなんですよって、なんで平気で言えるのか?世界的に知られた観光名所ですよ?トイレは外国から来た方も使います。日本のトイレはとても綺麗で快適だと思って使うでしょう。それがこの有り様ですよ。。トイレが綺麗なんて嘘でした。って思われるでしょう。どこかの国のトイレは汚いなんて言ってるけど日本のトイレも汚かった!って思われるでしょう。何故前からなら改善しないのですか?一刻も早く毎日綺麗に保とうとしないのですか?空港だって、駅だって世界の色んな人が使いますよね?でも綺麗に掃除されてます。週末は手が無いって意味わかりません。毎日キレイを保てるようにスタッフ雇用してください!恥ずかしいです。浅草寺は立派でもトイレは最低って世界の人に言われますよ?浅草寺のお偉方、何とかしてください!,Tripadvisor
I'm glad I visited but it was incredibly busy despite going on a random Tuesday! In all honestly how busy it was did put me off a little.

"Senso-ji Temple is a Buddhist temple dating to 645. From the entrance at Kaminarimon Gate to the temple many stalls line around the road and the surrounding area. Here are places for good souvenir buying with variety and fair prices. It is also a place to purchase kimonos…and basically everything, including food of every variety . The shoppers paradise area is extensive.

The Temple in the Asakusa area honors Kannon, the goddess of mercy. There are the usual Buddhist Temple aspects of the main hall as well as a 5-story pagoda. We saw many men and women in traditional dress. We visited during cherry blossom season and the traditional dress was a beautiful sight to behold.

Across the street from the Kaminarimon Gate is an excellent Visitor Information Office with two important attributes: 1) there is a dedicated person who speaks English and 2). On the top floor is a free Observation Viewpoint where one can gleam a great view of many historic areas in the city, including Tokyo Sky Tree as well has Senso-ji Temple complex.

"Tra i 2 disneyland questo è sicuramente il mio preferito! Ci sono attrazione più per i grandi, ma anche i più piccoli troveranno i loro spazi. lo spettacolo finale è unico.",Tripadvisor
"Good for photo. Have lots of very nice cafe. However, it was a gradual climb up, hence take your time and explore. If you need support walking, then can skip this place as there are similar places in Kyoto.",Tripadvisor
"Maybe the best place in Kyoto to visit . We went at 6 .30 am in the morning and it was wonderful . Took a cab up from the hotel and then walked down the steep slope to the bus top back to the station hotel . The views are outstanding , highly recommend",Tripadvisor
"Unico perché fuori dai classici canoni Disney, unico perché gestito da Giapponesi :) Ma comunque sempre un gran parco con attrazioni di primo livello da non perdere!",Tripadvisor
"Molto bello e grande, adatto anche ai genitori, occorre molto tempo e pazienza per le lunghe code. L'inglese non è parlato e questo crea non pochi problemi. Ben collegato alla città. Consigliato comunque per la sua unicità",Tripadvisor

"Otroligt vacker plats. I december ser man träden i alla färger. Har man tur kan man hitta en mysig plats att äta på, en sagolik upplevelse.",Tripadvisor
Molto bello esteticamente ..non vale assolutamente i soldi pagati per entrare. C è fila ovunque..fiumi di persone dalle attrazioni ai baracchini per prendere i pop Corn...tre ore (e sono davvero piu di tre ore)di fila per attrazioni che durano un minuto e che nella maggior parte dei casi non sono nemmeno così strabilianti. Giornata massacrante e davvero poco divertente. Dispiace perché è unico al mondo ma è davvero organizzato male.,Tripadvisor
"Il parco più bello del mondo..non a caso viene definito cosi!
Da visitare e visitare e visitare ancora..ogni minuscolo particolare è studiato per una tematizzazione perfetta..attrazioni meno adrenaliniche di Disneyland Paris.
Degno di nota anche il fatto che il cibo all'interno del parco abbia prezzi modesti.",Tripadvisor
Posto davvero bellissimo. Da consigliare a grandi e piccini. L'atmosfera giapponese lo arricchisce di quell'ordine e tranquillità che fa godere meglio delle bellissime attrazioni. Consiglio anche il soggiorno all'hotel.,Tripadvisor
"Ciao a tutti, sono appena rientrata in albergo dopo una goornata a disney sea.. voglio esser molto sincera quindi premettendo che l ambientazione è bella come tutti i parchi disney.. per quel che riguarda i giovani con voglia di giochi adrenalinici e divertenti non credo sia il posto giusto NON CI SONO giochi di questo tipo.. tranne una montagna russa chiusa per restrutturazione,ma solo giochi carini per famiglie con durata brevissima e code infinite.. noi per dare retta a recensioni altrui ci siamo cascati convinti di passare una giornata in totale divertimento invece il nostro unico divertimento è stato guardare la moda giapponese e quanto tengano a questo genere di personaggi. Vorrei che i ragazzi che come noi decidono di passare una giornata delle loro vacanze così lo facciano in totale consapevolezza e non si facciano condizionare da chi di andrenalina e divertimento a quanto pare non ne conoscono. Inoltre il parco è grande ma in un giorno si gira tranquillamente.. spero di esservi stata d aiuto ..ah..i giapponesi sono molto carini e disponibili con noi italiani ci hanno aiutato in tutto pur non capendoci :-)",Tripadvisor
"I visited twice - once in the afternoon, and once at 6AM. Go at 6AM. When I went in the afternoon, it was unbelievably crowded. It was honestly an unpleasant experience. The shopping streets was simply pedestrian traffic. However, I had an otherworldly experience this morning when I went.

I took the bus to the complex and walked up the hill at 5:30AM. I really enjoyed the opportunity to admire the traditional architecture with minimal passer-by's. The majority were locals, I think, who always greeted me, ""Ohayougozaimasu!"" They all were speed-walking as well.

I arrived at 6AM, alongside a group of 20-30 people. It was superb. There were many stretches when I was entirely alone, or with one other person. The pagoda in the front, for example, is incredible when there are only maximum 20 others viewing it, instead of 200. Because no one was around, I could completely marvel at the architecture. One could also feel the serenity of the mountain and the nature; there were still so many red leaves. Most importantly, it was a great space for reflection and gratitude - there was no hustle and bustle. I want to remember how grateful I felt for everything I had in my life when I was there.

At the entrance, there were runners who lapped the pagoda. Inside the fee-paying zone, there were plenty people (I assume regulars) who were praying as they sped along the complex. It was a really interesting community to observe. At the bottom, there was a group of people who were filling up their water at a shrine. I don't know why, but it was really compelling.

It was really a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to admire a tranquil Kiyomizu-dera at 6AM. I exhort anyone who is going to Kyoto to do the same.",Tripadvisor
11月末のライトアップ見学で、入り口まではツアーで、中はフリーで歩きました。昼間見る懸造の本堂や奥の院から一望できる京都の景色、紅葉の見事さなど、多くの方が訪れたがるのももっともです。夜は夜で、心もとない明かりで見る、怪しげな雰囲気も感じられ、それもそれでよかったです。夜でも、人の流れに押されて歩くほど混んでいました。成就院の庭園も別料金で拝見しました。,Tripadvisor
"Questo è veramente bello, grande ed imponente , bellissime attrazioni , pulizia quasi maniacale buon cibo , purtroppo file che superavano anche le 2 ore. fast pass troppo dilatati con i tempi",Tripadvisor
"Ci sono stato l'ultimo giorno di vacanza in Giappone, avevo letto recensioni entusiastiche che lo definivano il parco a tema disney più bello del mondo, inoltre spaventato da altre recensioni avevo anche controllato su Tokyo sea disney crowds il tempo di attesa per le attrazioni. Il giorno da me scelto era indicato in giallo come tempi di attesa, è da notare che non c'è quasi mai un giorno verde, su una scala verde-giallo-rosso. Qualche parere: il prezzo è in media con quello dei parchi disney 6900 yen circa 50 euro ma il parco non mi è sembrato assolutamente il più bel parco disney al mondo, io come metro di giudizio ho solo euro disney che comunque è molto più grande ed adrenalinico, le attrazioni sono poco emozionanti, merita un eccezione la torre del terrore, mentre le altre che a detta di varie recensioni dovrebbero essere dedicate ad un pubblico più adulto rispetto a quelle del vicino tokyo disneyland mi sono sembrate molto soft, anche per un parco disney. Veniamo al tasto più dolente, le code, le code partono in media da 45 minuti se siete fortunati e arrivano tranquillamente a 130 min e oltre per le attrazioni più richieste, siamo in Giappone che è sinonimo di alta densità di popolazione e pazienza zen, non aspettatevi quindi gli standard occidentali, il parco è sempre strapieno e perciò non è fruibile e non è godibile si rischiano di passare tranquillamente 5-6 ore in coda per neanche 30 minuti di attrazioni, per esempio il raging spirits l'unico piccolo rollercoaster del parco minuti di giro per 100 di coda. Controllare su Tokyo sea disney o Tokyo disneyland crowds i giorni più affollati da evitare assolutamente i rossi, ma a mio parere anche i gialli.
C'è il sistema fast pass che può aiutare ad agevolare i tempi di attesa e consiste in questo: davanti alle attrazioni ci sono delle macchinette che emettono dei biglietti fast pass ovvero dei biglietti che ti fanno saltare la coda tornando in una determinata fascia oraria, questi biglietti vengono emessi dopo che la macchina scannerizza il proprio biglietto di ingresso al parco, il problema è che se ne può fare uno per un attrazione e dopo bisogna aspettare un'altra ora abbondante per farne un altro per un'altra attrazione, i biglietti fast pass tra l'altro non vengono sempre emessi ma ce ne è un numero limitato quindi anche potendo potreste comunque non riuscire a farlo. Per chi viaggia da solo ci sarebbe l'opzione single rider per le due attrazioni di indiana jones ma non sempre funziona perché a quanto pare ce n'è un numero limitato, cosa assurda perché ho notato che spesso rimangono seggiolini vuoti in tutte le attrazioni perché sono pochi quelli che vanno da soli.
Che dire secondo me sono soldi persi è un parco giapponese fatto per i giapponesi che hanno molta più pazienza di noi in fatto di code. È inoltre super valutato da molte recensioni.",Tripadvisor
"Abbiamo programmato questa giornata di divertimento studiando bene e alungo il parco e tutte le attrazioni, scegliendo una giornata infrasettimanale e arrivando prestissimo la mattina. Di solito mi piace raccontare la mia esperienza nel dettaglio e così ho fatto per gli altri 5 parchi Disney visitati nel mondo. Per questo non ho invece proprio voglia di raccontare nulla, tanto negativa è stata la esperienza. Unico plauso va alla bella scenografia del parco e agli spettacoli sul mediterran harbur in particolare Fantasmic di sera in chiusura.
Il resto delusione e sconforto per tantissimi motivi e in particolare per aver pagato circa 230 euro in 4 (biglietti e cibi/bibite vari) per aver visto poco o nulla e per la rabbia che ci ha accompagnato tutto il giorno! Motivi ? eccoli telegrafici:
- Massa di gente presente esagerata al limite della sicurezza;file ovunque di ore tanto che in una giornata solo 2 attrazioni di pochi secondi e nemmeno quelle più gettonate; personale che non parla inglese; organizzazione di gestione delle file carente e inadeguata; fastpass inutile e non più attivo dopo poche ore perchè tutto prenotato; rapporto entrate 1 normale 10 fast pass e questi erano sempre centinaia e centinaia, così in fila se non lo hai ci stai 3/4 ore per attrazione; orde di ragazzi locali che monopolizzano ogni cosa correndo all'impazzata e tutti vestiti in serie ;locali e ristoranti sempre pieni e quindi poco curati e puliti; assoluta mancanza di attenzione per i turisti europei;
In conclusione un vero disastro e reputo che la causa sia della direzione del parco che non è in grado di studiare adeguati sistemi per garantire a tutti un equo e giusto divertimento in rapporto al costo elevato del biglietto! Rimangono quindi nei nostri ricordi solo le foto che allego sempre volentieri ma non consiglio a nessuno questa esperienza!

Went here in the afternoon and it was very busy. Early morning would definitely be better but we had other plans for that time. The temple complex is amazing and the views are gorgeous. We hiked up the hill past a cemetery and the climb is not too bad. Came down through the shopping street which was very crowded.,Tripadvisor
"Il parco divertimenti più organizzato che abbia mai visitato.
Tutto è grandioso e tecnicamente stupefacente.
Ricordatevi di prendere i fast pass ( ottenibili gratuitamente, fino a tre al giorno circa)
e di partecipare alla lotteria per gli spettacoli.",Tripadvisor
"Marvelous temple, very beautiful, but take good walking shoes because the way up to the temple can be hard on the legs and feet. Other than that, the 400 yen cover was worth it! Beautiful views, stunning nature passages, and the calm sense of nature and peace will welcome you as you walk along the different kinds of paths that there are to discover in this temple. There is also a part of the temple that is under construction, but nothing that will hinder the other views. The little store that sells amulets and Omikuji fortune draws opens at 8:30 am, so take a good jacket if you're going in the early morning, since the temperatures can reach the 50's and you will freeze.",Tripadvisor
"Ci siamo recati al parco per diversificare il soggiorno a Tokyo, cosa che senz’altro rifarei, ma comunque non sono stata completamente soddisfatta.

Abbiamo preso il pass per la sera durante un venerdì non festivo alla fine di giugno con meteo perfetta.

Noi abbiamo preso il bus, che nonostante costi qualcosa in più è molto più comodo ed arriva davanti al parco. Altrimenti dovete camminare 15 minuti (velocemente) oppure prendere il trenino disney a pagamento (ahahah).
Per entrare si forma la fila circa una mezz’ora prima, che comunque si smaltisce in fretta. Cercherei comunque di arrivare almeno 15 min prima delle 18.
Scordatevi di fare tutte le attrazioni, quindi abbiate una strategia: noi abbiamo fatto 2 delle più amate (indiana jones e quella vicino) e poi 3 lente e fantasmic alle 20. Per il resto non c’è tempo. Il parco chiudeva alle 22.
Tempi di attesa: per la tower of terror c’erano 2 ore di attesa. 1.5 per nemo e per toystory. Indiana jones era marcato con 45 minuti, ce l’abbiamo fatta in 35. Il viaggio al centro della terra era chiuso (va beh...)
I fast pass erano tutti finiti e quando diventa buio cominciano sistematicamente a chiudere tutti gli snack point, cosa che trovo molto fastidiosa. Dopo le 21 si trovano solo popcorn e dopo le 21.30 sono chiusi tutti i ristoranti. Con il buio le strade sono poco illuminate, si vede ben poco e comincia anche a fare freddo dato che c’è parecchio vento data la vicinanza alla costa. Personaggi disney non ne ho visti. In generale curato ma non così grande e non così impressionante o degno di nota. Le attrazioni sono corte e piuttosto per bambini un pò grandi.
In generale lo rifarei ma non mi ha entusiasmato parecchio: un giorno intero sarebbe stato probabilmente un po’ noioso dato le file oscene - con una buona strategia, fast pass e single rider (stessa fila che con il fast pass) si può sicuramente ottimizzare. Mi da l’impressione che i giapponesi ci vadano solo per comprare souvenir.
Non mi sono pentita ma non mi è piaciuto particolarmente.",Tripadvisor
"Abbiamo avuto un'esperienza negativissima. Innanzi tutto arrivati al parco con biglietto acquistato sul loro sito ufficiale, abbiamo dovuto pagare la monorail che ti porta al parco dalla metro e non era indicata da nessuna parte. Altri 7 euro andata e ritorno non previsti. Le giostre più belle erano chiuse per ristrutturazione (sia Viaggio al centro della terra, sia Toy story etc). La fila per la giostra più banale è stata di almeno un ora fino ad arrivare a 2 ore per indiana jones. Praticamente in una giornata riesci a fare un paio di giostre perdendo gli spettacoli che a differenza dei parchi americani sono pochi al giorno. La struttura è bella nulla da dire, gli spettacoli quei pochi visti sono belli ma non si possono spendere 300 euro per una famiglia di 4 persone per 1 giorno solo per vedere uno spettacolo e per fare 3 giostre (3 perchè sono quelle prenotabili con fastpass). Non lo consiglio per nulla. Ho cercato una mail della Disney per rappresentare il disagio non ho trovato",Tripadvisor
".. fängt den Wurm - dachten wir und waren bereits vor 8 Uhr in der ganz wunderbaren

Nun gut, kulturelle Bildung muss auch sein....
Immerhin war der Andrang beim letzten roten Tempel/Schrein , von dem man auch eine sehr schöne Aussicht hat, relativ gering.

"Mi hanno chiesto se mi sia piaciuto di più Disneyland Paris (visitato l'ultima volta lo scorso agosto) o Tokyo Disney Sea. Trovo che siano due parchi bellissimi, diversi tra loro e con punti di forza differenti, ma che nessuno dei due sia superiore all'altro. In entrambi ci sono giochi molto belli e divertentissimi, ma a Tokyo Disney Sea ho trovato una cura molto maggiore nell'ambientazione. La Mermaid Lagoon e la Mysterious Island (le mie due zone preferite del parco) sono pazzesche. E pure il Mediterranean Harbor è fatto davvero bene. Il Toy Story Mania! ha lo stesso un'ambientazione che mi è piaciuta di più rispetto al Buzz Lightyear Laser Blast di Disneyland Paris (in pratica sono lo stesso gioco), ma a parte l'ambientazione il divertimento che ti regalano le due attrazioni è lo stesso. Per quanto riguarda lo shopping Disney vince Disneyland Paris, i cui shop mi piacciono molto di più.

Abbiamo comunque trascorso una bellissima giornata (anche se pioveva: non riesco a visitare un parco Disney senza che piova, deve essere una maledizione), riuscendo a fare molti giochi grazie ai fast pass. Andando per ordine, le attrazioni migliori sono state: nell'American Waterfront la Tower of Terror (dove ho perso 10 anni di vita) e Toy Story Mania! Nella Mysterious Island Journey to the Centre of The Earth (ma anche 20mila leghe sotto i mari non è male). A Port Discovery Aquatopia è carinissimo, e pure il gioco 3D Nemo&Friends Sea Rider (se a Disneyland Paris vi è piaciuto il gioco Star Tours in 3D, molto probabilmente vi piacerà anche questo). Nella Mermaid Lagoon era tutto bellissimo, a partire dal pavimento morbido che fa un effetto strano sotto i piedi e contribuisce a sentirsi ""in fondo al mar"": il Blowfish Balloon Race dura troppo poco. Nel Mediterranean Harbor abbiamo fatto un giro in gondola, e mi viene ancora da ridere se ci penso :D Nell'Arabian Coast abbiamo fatto il Sindbad's Story book Voyage, che ho trovato davvero noioso, poi siamo entrati a vedere il The Magic Lamp Theater, uno spettacolo teatrale con effetti 3D molto carino ma purtroppo in giapponese quindi per noi poco godibile. A Lost River Delta non ho fatto niente perché la Tower of Terror mi aveva messa sottosopra :P, ho preso però il Disney Transit Steamer Line, che ti fa fare una mini crociera di 10 minuti da lì sino al Mediterranean Harbor, passando per la Mysterious Island, la Arabian Coast e la Mermaid Lagoon.

Consigli: usate i fast pass per le attrazioni con maggior fila. Appena entrati, se siete interessati al gioco, prendete subito quello di Toy Story Mania! perché c'è così tanta gente che ci vuole giocare, che già nel primo pomeriggio tolgono la possibilità di fare i fast pass. Fate tutti i fast pass che potete :)",Tripadvisor
"Il Giappone è stato magico, ma questo parco ancora di più! Veramente diverso da disneyland paris! Tutte le attrazioni sono state stupende ed una più bella dell'altra... Assolutamente consigliate le attrazioni di Indiana Jones e journey to the center of the earth! Comunque visto che non è vietato consiglio di portare il pranzo da casa, neanche tanto per il costo, quanto per la fila nei ristoranti.",Tripadvisor
"Parco carino, ampio, con attrazioni divertenti per bambini e adulti. Bello soprattutto il Raging Spirits (montagne russe abbastanza ""turbolente"", con tanto di giro della morte, e il Journey to the Centre of the Earth.
Ma attenzione: le file sono incredibili (fino a due ore - due!!! - per attrazioni di pochi minuti). Un incubo per chi dà valore al proprio tempo. È bene andare presto e prenotare, gratuitamente, le attrazioni più interessanti.",Tripadvisor
"La mia recensione è viziata da una situazione che spero di non vedere più in nessun parco Disney. Anche se la giornata era fredda e leggermente piovosa, abbiamo incontrato letteralmente un fiume di gente impressionante!!! Code di più di un'ora ad ogni attrazzione!!! Code per prendere da bere, andare in bagno o fare qualsiasi altra cosa!!! Allucinante!! Tenetene conto, tantissima gente!! Io e mia moglie siamo stati ad Orlando..... quindi siamo abituati alle code nei parchi Disney ( visti anche Disney Paris , California e Hong Kong... ma nessuno è affollato come questo!!). Tra l'altro era mercoledì!! Tenete presente in caso vogliate farci visita. Poi è tutto in stile Disney quindi impeccabile..... ma ripeto: TROPPA GENTE!!",Tripadvisor
"A Tokyo ci sono 2 parchi Disney, uno e' Disneyland Tokyo, di proprietà' della Disney, l'altro e' questo: DisneySea. Questo parco non e' proprietà della Disney: e' proprietà di una azienda giapponese, che paga i diritti alla Disney, Alla prova dei fatti, comunque, e' un parco Disneyland come tutti gli altri, con tutti i personaggi e i temi della Disney.
Offre varie zone a tema ampie e spettacolari (tra cui Arabeggiante, Veneziana, Vulcanica, America anni 30, Futuristica, e mondo della Sirenetta), tante attrazioni divertentissime (tra cui Toy Story, Tower of Terror, 20,000 leghe sotto i mari, viaggio al centro della terra, Indiana Jones, tappeti volanti di Aladdin, spettacolo 3D del Genio di Aladdin, le giostre della Sirenetta), infiniti ristoranti a tema e miriadi di negozi di gadget e pupazzi Disney. Oltretutto la gestione giapponese offre una pulizia ed una organizzazione impeccabili.
Unico neo: file infinite anche di 3 ore, aggirabili solo tramite dei biglietti saltafile che pero' possono essere acquistati gratuitamente solo una volta ogni ora da apposite macchinette sparse nel parco. Purtroppo i biglietti saltafile sono in numero limitato e finiscono presto.
Per il resto: LUOGO FANTASTICO, come tutti i Disneyland del mondo!",Tripadvisor
"Il tempio e gli altri edifici che compongono il sito è molto bello ma pieno di turistici e quindi te lo godi poco.
Situato sulle pendici del monte sopra Kyoto, aggiunge bellezza a ciò che è già bello.
Sicuramente da vedere ma consiglio di andarci all'apertura",Tripadvisor
Un luogo turistico non da perdere!! Pensate che il biglietto sia caro?? Ma no!!! Dovete visitare assortamente !! Dalla Tokyo stazione ci vogliono 20 minuti circa. Ci sono tanti attrazioni. Quindi prima dovete guardare bane al sito di Disneysea. E meglio organizza . Penso di utile prendere fast pass. Ci sono le guide che parlano inglese. Andate con le scarpe comodissime per fare la lungo coda. Ci sono i protagonisti speciali . Due orsetti tipici di Tokyo Disneysea!!,Tripadvisor
"Ce temple est absolument infernal. Beau mais tellement blindé de monde que ça en gâche tout le potentiel. Il est impossible de marcher 10 secondes sans devoir s'arrêter devant des gens qui se prennent en selfies ou tapent la pose devant chaque mur, on s'est carrément fait virer des escaliers par un gros type qui voulait prendre des photos de groupe. Allez-y tôt le matin si voulez être tranquille.",Tripadvisor
"Uno di quei casi in cui gli slogan non sono soltanto un'altisonante finzione.
Il DisneySea è davvero il parco più bello del mondo, sia rispetto gli altri parchi che ho visitato, sia per l'esperienza in sé.
L'impatto con il parco è mozzafiato. Le scenografie sono straordinarie, e la cura certosina per ogni microscopico dettaglio è commovente. Nulla è lasciato al caso e l'impressione generale è di trovarsi davvero immersi nel bacino del Mediterraneo, con i suoi paesini, i velieri, le cupole orientali, la vegetazione e...Venezia! Si resta davvero senza parole.
Anche solo guardare il parco vale il prezzo del biglietto. E invece le attrazioni non solo lo valorizzano ulteriormente, ma sono tanto tecnicamente perfette e coinvolgenti da voler ripetere l'esperienza all'infinito. Per citarne solo due, Journey to the center of the earth (definita la miglior attrazione al mondo) e Indiana Jones. Queste due attrazioni valgono ogni attesa.
A proposito di attesa, consiglio caldamente di prendere il primo fast-pass appena entrati al parco, in modo da avere la possibilità di prenderne almeno altri due durante il giorno.
Le file ci sono, sono lunghe, ma il tempo passa velocemente e la qualità delle attrazioni ripaga dell'attesa. In caso di grande affluenza e quindi di necessarie selezioni, consiglio assolutamente, e in quest'ordine: Journey to the Center of the Earth, Indiana Jones, Tower of terror, 20.000 leagues e Raging Spirits.
Un grande elogio va all'organizzazione, all'ordine, alla cortesia generale e agli stessi ospiti, prevalentemente giapponesi: silenziosi, tranquilli, ordinati e corretti in ogni occasione. Un'esperienza meravigliosa e, inutile dirlo, consigliatissima.
Contattatemi per qualsiasi informazione.",Tripadvisor

"In the ancient city of Kyoto, Kiyomizu-dera stands out as a spiritual haven for travelers, offering a unique blend of historical charm and dynamic beauty. This temple is not just an ideal spot for cherry blossom and autumn foliage viewing but also a gateway to experiencing Japan's traditional culture and spirituality.

🌸 Spring Blossoms: As cherry blossoms bloom, Kiyomizu-dera becomes a cloud of pink, with delicate petals dancing down the storied stage, whisking visitors away into an elegant world reminiscent of ukiyo-e art.

🍁 Autumnal Glory: The temple's surrounding maple trees blaze with fiery colors, where the red leaves alongside the ancient stone steps merge Zen with the romance of fall.

🍵 Nestled in the quaint streets by Kiyomizu-dera, teahouses and craft shops abound, offering a taste of traditional Japanese sweets and matcha, as well as a glimpse into the daily lives and artisanal beauty of Kyoto residents.

⛩️ The temple itself, a national treasure, has not only witnessed the historical shifts of Kyoto but also provides a ""Stage of Kiyomizu,"" an unparalleled vantage point to behold the city's splendor, promising to uplift every spirit.

🌙 The special night openings reveal a different allure, with the millennia-old temple bathed in light, cloaked in mystery. The nocturnal view of cherry blossoms and maple trees at Kiyomizu-dera has become an unmissable sight for those exploring Kyoto after dusk.

Kiyomizu-dera is more than a temple; it symbolizes Kyoto and epitomizes Japanese culture. Step into Kiyomizu-dera and engage in a silent dialogue with a thousand years of history, finding peace and purity within.

A Night to Remember: As the day ends, unwind in the soothing ambiance of Tsubaki Ann Kyoto. Let the calmness of the night sky envelop you, promising a peaceful slumber.

"We went to this temple on a weekend, which was probably a bad idea, because the whole area including the temple were very crowded.

The temple itself was beautiful, but we probably enjoyed wandering through the surrounding markets leading up to it more, especially the massive fried chicken schnitzels from Asakusa Anshinya which were fresh and delicious and only 600yen each.

We also went to the top of the Asakusa culture tourist informtion centre (free lookout) and looked down on the temple/ markets and out across the city. It was a nice view but not amazing.",Tripadvisor
Impressive temple in Asakusa. We went early to avoid the crowds but it was still busy although it didn't detract from our enjoyment of this stunning place,Tripadvisor
We stopped here while with a personal guide. It is VERY close to the train station and in the middle of the city which I guess is why it's so crowded. Tons of shops and wonderful temple but it was just too crowded to fully enjoy. We had a better experience at other lesser known temples.,Tripadvisor

Есть там и возможность пополнить свои запасы сувениров, как и перекусить, но мусорных ведер не имеется. В части мест нельзя делать фото, а так там много и растений.

Our coach dropped us off at the end of Nakamise-dori Street requiring us take the long walk passed many tourist shops to get to the temple and its surrounding area.

Several groups were wearing kimono’s and very nice they looked. The temple to my undiscerning eyes was much the same as others.,Tripadvisor
Avis très mitigé entre la beauté du temple (ainsi que les petits temples à proximité) mais gâchée par la foule (dont nous faisions partie…) bruyante et souvent sans gêne.

This one stands apart as it has a thriving market leading up to it, full of souvenir shop and food stalls. It gets very crowded, but still great fun.",Tripadvisor
"100% worth a visit. The shops leading up to the temple are lovely, it's a free attraction, and the gardens are beautiful.",Tripadvisor
Kiyomizu is rated either 1 or 2 as a must see spot in Kyoto. We agree that it's an important site to visit and its elevation does give you a view of Kyoto. As one of the top tourist attractions in Kyoto the reason for our three star rating is the sheer number of crowds and large number of vendors that line the streets leading to the temple. Would recommend going early to try to beat the crowds.,Tripadvisor
"Loved this temple, amazing views over the beautiful city of Kyoto. Lovely to walk around and take in the culture of Japan. The side streets up to the temple are well worth a look as they are traditional Japanese streets and we just loved it here",Tripadvisor
"Il parco è unico, pulito, enorme così come lo sono le sue attrazioni... che non sono facili da vedere a causa delle file di minimo due ore che bisogna affrontare, ci siamo recati al parco la mattina presto sperando proprio di evitarle, ma i giapponesi sono tanti e molto più pazienti rispetto a noi. Armatevi di pazienza !",Tripadvisor
Nice temples to visit in Tokyo. It’s crowded but that adds to the atmosphere. Plenty of souvenirs and eateries nearby. You can visit the Skytree afterwards which is nearby.,Tripadvisor
"Spent the morning today at the Senso-ji temple and it didn’t disappoint. The temple itself and the surrounding buildings were amazing. Furthermore, the little shops in front of the temple have all sorts of things to purchase for friends and family. Senso-ji is a must see when visiting Tokyo",Tripadvisor
Da grandi appassionati di parchi dei divertimenti abbiamo deciso di passare anche di qui. Stupendo come ogni parco disney peccato che a parer nostro le attrazioni sono un po meno adrenaliniche rispetto alle nostre europee,Tripadvisor
"We took a taxi using the GO App from our hotel - arrived at 10 am and it was crowded with tourists and large tour groups. There are a lot of souvenir and snack shops leading toward the Temple.
Entrance fee for the Temple is 400 Yen. It’s beautiful - view is definitely worth the entrance. A must visit if you’re in Kyoto.",Tripadvisor
"Perfetto su tutti i fronti: attrazioni, personale, pulizia e organizzazione. Rispetto al vicino Disney Land propone attrazioni più adrenaliniche e una parade sull'acqua spettacolare.

"Siamo stati a Tokyo Disney Sea poco dopo la sua riapertura, il 13 Maggio 2011, due mesi dopo i tragici fatti dell'11 Marzo, e, probabilmente, è stato per questo che, oltre al fatto che era un venerdì, di gente ne abbiamo trovato pochissima. Ciò ci ha permesso di evitare, ovviamente, le code e di goderci quello che il parco ha da offrire. Innanzitutto la tematizzazione. Il Disney Sea di Tokyo è probabilmente il più bel parco Disney del mondo: sembra di essere davvero in una città portuale che si affaccia su di un lago meraviglioso (dove abbiamo anche assistito ad un bellissimo spettacolo acquatico con tanto di imbarcazioni, ballerini e fuochi di artificio). I negozi ed i ristoranti sono favolosi, i cast member davvero gentilissimi (ma essendo giapponesi la cosa era ovvia ^^), il luogo pulitissimo e ben curato. Il vero problema che ha questo parco sono però le attrazioni. Ce ne sono poche di alto livello, tanto che alla fine facevamo spesso Indiana Jones e Journey to the Center of the Earth. ;a questo non ha sminuito la bellissima esperienza, tanto che contiamo di tornarci quando riandremo in Giappone. Anche perché quando ci ricapiterà mai di fare OTTO volte Indiana Jones :)",Tripadvisor
"siamo stati a Tokyo Disney Resort a marzo 2012, parco bellissimo specialmente questo del DisneySea, con tematizzazione favolosa,incredibile, attrazioni incredibili.
personale gentilissim, i migliori cast member di qualunque altro parco Disney ( e li ho visti tutti e 5), buon cibo presentato in modo magnifico.
Pulitissimo e ordinato,un unico difetto: la marea umana di persone che lo frequentano, che fanno lievitare i tempi di attesa delle attrazioni da un minimo di 100 ad un massimo di 260 minuti (per la Tower of Terror).
Biglietti fastpass terminati già alle 12.....comunque,almeno una volta nella vita,bisogna visitare questo capolavoro di parco del divertimento,sopratutto per chi é amante della Disney e dei suoi parchi tematici.",Tripadvisor
"Ottimo parco tematico,vi consiglio di acquistare i biglietti nei box a tokyo e risparmiate 1000 yen oltre a non fare la coda per entrare. Di solito è molto frequentato e quindi vi consiglio di entrare presto se volete fare e vedere tutto.Le attrazioni principali hanno un tempo di attesa di 45 minuti e quindi vi consiglio di fare il fast pass davanti ad ogni attrazione e questo vi consente di entrare senza coda dopo 2 ore circa.
Anche se il parco non è di proprietà della Disney ma di una società privata giapponese la qui paga delle royaltie astronomiche per poter utilizzare il nome e personaggi,devo dire che questo è solo secondo a quelli americani,e quindi migliore di quello di Parigi e Hong Kong.

Nello stesso complesso si trova il teatro del CIRQUE DU SOLEIL con lo spettacolo ZED,fantastico come tutti gli spettacoli di questa compagnia.
e il classico Disneyland.

Quindi sia che abbiate dei bambini sia che siate adulti,una giornata in questo magnifico posto è consigliato se vi trovate a TOKYO.",Tripadvisor
"Experience the captivating spirituality and immersive beauty of Sensoji Temple. Although crowded, this awe-inspiring destination is undeniably worth a visit.",Tripadvisor
"This is a must see in Kyoto! We traveled with three teens and they loved it- so much to see, hear, smell and learn about. Great views of Kyoto as well. The “main” little path through the village is good to do once (up to the temple, or down from). Upon exiting the temple, look for the stairs/road the goes to the left… it will take you down a quiet neighborhood road with more tourist shops and food.",Tripadvisor
"Lieu très touristique, certes joli mais auquel il manque le cachet de plus petits temples/sanctuaires. Si vous ne faites que Tokyo, il faut le visiter.

Antes de llegar hay que avanzar por un montón de tiendas y puestos de comida callejera. Recomendable madrugar ya que, a partir de las once la marea de gente hace difícil avanzar y hacer fotos.",Tripadvisor
京都で一番人気の場所。京都駅から比較的近いので帰りに回ると駅に向かうバスが満員で乗れないとの情報が多くみられる。そこで朝6時に開門拝観できるのは8時頃からなのでここから観光をスタートすることを勧める。本堂の舞台も、音羽の滝も並ぶことはない。御朱印を頂ける本堂近く、阿弥陀堂の横、音羽の滝の前の納経所も8時頃から開きます。御朱印も11種類あるのでどこでどんなものいただくか狙いを定める予習が必要。本堂から音羽の滝に降りる階段は混雑時は基本下りの一方通行ですから、阿弥陀堂をうっかり通過してしまうと大変なことになります。音羽の滝は「恋愛」「学業」「健康」をかなえるとされていますが、もとは１つですのですいてるところを狙いましょう。,Tripadvisor

Get your fortune, breathe some incense, pray, donate a bit of money.

There are a lot of shops and food in the general area.

"Este templo foi um dos finalistas para escolha das sete maravilhas do mundo. Fomos em novembro e esta cheio de flores bonitas. Conhecidos foram em março e não estava florido.

"Sia perché percorribile a piedi dal nostro hotel sia perchè è stato il tempio visitato per primo e poi di nuovo ripercorso di buon mattino questo tempio mi è rimasto impresso. E dire che poi di templi buddhisti ne abbiamo visti tanti! Quali i motivi del forte impatto? L'atmosfera festosa un po' superstiziosa a tratti bigotta dei fedeli e degli scettici ma curiosi visitatori - leggere: rito dell'incenso, dei fogliettini di buona o pessima fortuna, i dolcetti zuccherini un po' gommosi, i sandali in corda da tastare... - tutto questo è folklore giapponese, circondati da palazzi avveniristici, antenne a spillo, casette sopravvisute a tante calamità. Ho fotografato una piccola sala che cucina dei noodles favolosi...",Tripadvisor
"Easily accessible by train and a superb landmark in the middle of the city.

Good photo opportunities with a beautiful park and moat surrounding the castle.

Inside the castle there are ton loads of historical facts on Hideyoshi Toyotomi and how he came about building the castle.

Get to the top for a good view of Osaka city.",Tripadvisor
"The blossom was delayed this year due to poor weather so it was delightful to see the blossom at the Castle. It was originally building started in 1583, after several transformations final building was completed 1931. The museum in the Castle Tower is very informative of its history and the previous rulers of the area. The castle tower is surrounded by citadels, gates, turrets, impressive stone walls and moats. The Nishinomaru Garden, encompassing the former ""western citadel"", is a lawn garden with 600 cherry trees, a tea house, the former Osaka Guest House and nice views of the castle tower from below. A fee is charged to visit the garden. The Osaka Castle Park covers a large area with lots of green space, sport facilities, a multi-purpose arena (Osakajo Hall) and a shrine dedicated to Toyotomi Hideyoshi. With over 600 cherry trees the park is one of Osaka's most popular spots during the cherry blossom season.
To celebrate Japan World Exposition 1970: EXPO '70. After three years of planning, research and construction, two time capsules identical in every detail were buried adjacent to Osaka Castle. The purpose of the project was to send forward in time a visual, aural and documentary record of life in the year 1970 AD. The scale of the project and the size of the capsules is unprecedented: each capsule contains 2,098 objects and recorded items representing the achievements of our civilization and the everyday experience of the Japanese people. Take a whole day to enjoy this beautiful site.",Tripadvisor
"Its a museum, not a castle. The inside is a modern building, don't go expecting to see any original construction. The exhibition inside is a bit like a theme park. The grounds and the outside are beautiful, but I would save my time and not bother queuing up and paying to go inside. Read the Wikipedia article instead.",Tripadvisor
"Magnifique de l'extérieur seulement. Ne payez pas pour entrer dans le château: c'est un musée relativement mediocre, pas un intérieur de château. En plus ils vous foutent dehors comme des voleurs à la fin de la journée, sans prévenir",Tripadvisor

"Great day out. Highly recommend going to the castle.
If you have a JR pass, you can fast track the line and get discount.
Take the stairs to get to the top as the line for the elevator is very long.
Don't worry there is a exhibition on each floor so you can rest.
Go on a clear day if possible as the view is wonderful",Tripadvisor
"Of our 10 days in Japan Osaka Castle was our favorite, especially since we got to go inside seeing all the historical photos and views from the 8th floor observation deck. Taking the tram to the castle was well worth it even though you need to pay again to ride to the beginning spot.",Tripadvisor
"The home castle of Osaka - A rich history and the castle has illustrations of war and events around Osaka's history.

Two floors have no pictures policy as the art works are copyrighted or private. There's a nice depiction of the Golden Tea Room, and also a miniature replica of the Summer War of Osaka.

The approach to the Castle is a bit of a Walk from parking lot. Also only one elevator is working currently, as others are under repair.

Worth a visit and to spend time to learn more about Osaka's history.",Tripadvisor

"On sait en venant visiter le château d'Osaka qu'il s'agit d'une reconstruction, comme de nombreux cas identiques au Japon. De l'extérieur c'est vrai il en impose et il est agréable de s'approcher et d'en découvrir les structures intérieures. Les choses se gâtent à l'intérieur ; non pas du fait de la reconstruction, mais on peine à avancer tant les flux humains à l'intérieur sans dense. Parfois certaines salles se dégagent un peu mais le contenu reste au fond assez pauvre et décevant. Seul le coût modique et la vue sur Osaka pourrait justifier une entrée finalement chronophage et décevante alors que l'extérieur était plein de promesses.",Tripadvisor
"The park and whole castle area is very beautiful, but the castle itself from inside a little bit disappointing as you are waiting a long time and not much to see.",Tripadvisor
"Impressive stone construction given is was built in the 15th century. An icon to Japan’s history of warlords.

The line was too long to wait for an inside view. Instead we walked the perimeter and avoided the hoards of tourists. The trees surrounding the castle and moat were especially colorful during our fall visit.

Look for turtles in the moat. They’re entertaining to watch.",Tripadvisor
"JR Pass gives a 10% discount and just as important access to a short line. There is an elevator that takes the visitor to the 8th floor observation deck where one can see the city laid out. Then walk down the stairs to each level where there are 3D pictures, dioramas, artifact displays and videos to enjoy. Each floor has its own historical time table and emphasis. Fascinating and enriching. When built in the 1500s, it was the largest castle in Japan. Plan at least two hours.",Tripadvisor
Enjoyed walking around the outside in the castle grounds. The inside of the castle is a 80’s esq. museum with no remnants of the original castle on show. The museum will interest those who are really interested in the castle’s history. The view at the top is good. If you really want to go inside it’s worth booking tickets online to save queueing.,Tripadvisor

An enchanting castle on top of a hill. The views are spectacular and there is a gorgeous pond on the periphery that makes for an amazing photo spot.,Tripadvisor
"Expect a long line to get in if you didn’t purchase your ticket online prior to going-if you want to see all the floors you have to use the stairs which are a pretty steep incline/decline, but there are elevators available if needed. This is a self guided tour and some floors are more crowded with tourists than others, depending on the displays. This is a museum in the castle, and I recommend going early if possible to cut down on the crowd congestion so you can take in all the information. It is very easy to get there and leave using the Osaka loop line. The park around the castle is very nice and there are plenty of shady spots to sit and enjoy an ice cream or a snack before or after walking up to the castle. Wear some comfortable shoes to do this! Overall, it’s a pretty interesting and inexpensive way to spend a few hours at a site worth seeing while in Osaka.",Tripadvisor
"前回は正門の「大手門」から、今回は「青屋門」から入城しました。
先ず平日で台風が接近しているにもかかわらず、人の多さにビックリ！

天守閣に上がって景色を眺めたかったのですが、あまりの行列に諦めて周辺をゆっくりと散策しました。

"There were very few attractions in Japan I was disappointed in…Osaka Castle looks amazing from the outside, and the grounds are beautiful…but I wouldn’t bother going inside…
Very modern, displays are ok…but not like an ancient Castle at all…anyway, I’ll leave it up to you..",Tripadvisor
¥600 better spent on anything else other than entering the castle. The interior is modern and no semblance of any old castle. Pictures and diagrams as well as replicas are on display and most are explained in English but does not feel worth the effort to climb 7 flights of stairs to see. Better stay in the gardens.,Tripadvisor
"It is always fun to visit Osaka Castle.
The gardens are well maintained and you can see the flowers in full bloom every season. The place often holds events, so you can enjoy it every time you go there.
Easy access from the station. It takes about 10 minutes by walk from the nearest station, so access is not a problem at all.
Highly recommend to visit this place. ",Tripadvisor
Very disappointed. Information suggested exhibit included 'extensive display of weapons and armour'. There were 3 pieces of armour and 2 swords. The remainder of exhibition were silk screen paintings showing scenes from various battles. Gardens were petty but you don't need a ticket for them.,Tripadvisor
"Again about castles, inside this one was also a nice museum, but nothing that took my breath away or anything like that, the cherry trees gave a beautiful charm around it and in the photos, but we liked the park and the walk around it more than the castle itself.",Tripadvisor
"We added Osaka Castle to our itinerary with the expectation of being able to explore the interior, but upon arrival, we learned it operates primarily as a museum. After reviewing online feedback, it became evident that most visitors found the admission fee, roughly 600 yen, unjustified. Instead, we opted to appreciate the castle's exterior and stroll through the picturesque grounds. Before reaching the castle entrance, visitors can explore a public center housing gift shops and restaurants that offer quick bites. There are public restrooms located on the first floor, with the second floor typically less crowded than the first.

In retrospect, while Osaka Castle holds historical significance, there are far more captivating attractions to experience within the city. Unless you're a fervent history enthusiast or have a particular interest in the castle's museum exhibits, I would not recommend dedicating substantial time here.

For travelers seeking a comprehensive Osaka experience, it might be wiser to prioritize a city tour. Osaka has a multitude of vibrant districts, culinary experiences, and cultural treasures that arguably provide a more immersive and memorable visit.",Tripadvisor
"It's essentially a museum with a cool exterior. We got there around 9:40 I could see the crowds coming from the distance. We explored the castle lots of different translations available for the exhibits. The evlator has been out of service for quite a while, so it's currently not accessible for people who are unable to do stairs. I enjoyed walking the garden and exterior area than actually being inside the ""castle.""By 10:30, the queue for people without Osaka city pass was very long. If you feel like this is a must-see for you, then get the ciy pass so you can skip the line. This site was lame for our group. There are many cooler castles in Japan. I say take exterior photos and move on to your next adventure.",Tripadvisor
Fila lunghissima sotto il sole per accedere all’interno del castello e proprio non ne vale la pena! Divertente solo la possibilità di fare ( a pagamento) fotografie vestiti da Samurai . Belli i giardini,Tripadvisor
"A beautiful castle from the exterior with lovely grounds but while the view from the top was good the actual inside of the castle was modernised and disappointing. It was 7 floors of museum (with no elevator due to extended maintenance) and the throng of people made it a slow go, so we gave up and went to the other castle building which had an excellent figurine exhibition. Hot tip: if you do buy castle tickets in advance and receive a QR code, join the line at service point 2 (less queuing).",Tripadvisor
"Bin direkt zum 8ten Stock hinauf gestiegen. Die Aussicht lohnt sich. Danach bin ich Stockwerk um Stockwerk hinunter.

Das hätte ich auch in einem Buch nachlesen können.

"Quelle déception !
Je pensais visiter un château tel que ceux que l'on trouve en France avec le mobilier de l'époque, des scènes reproduisant le style de vie, des explications sur des tableaux ou autres bibelots ... rien de tout cela ici : il s'agit d'un musée où il est même interdit de prendre des photos des armures de l'époque (armures qui se comptent sur les doigts des mains).
20 minutes de queue sous 33 degrés pour 20 minutes dans cette sorte de musée moderne où seul un passionné de l'histoire médiévale japonaise y trouvera son bonheur. Mieux vaut d'ailleurs savoir lire le japonais car tout n'est pas traduit.
A titre d'exemple, vous pourrez admirer des casques, vous saurez leur composition mais pas qui les porter ni à quelle occasion.",Tripadvisor
"We visited Osaka Castle on a Monday in April. A lovely day and busy by 10am. A short wait in line to access the ticket vending machine and we joined the hordes.

We made the mistake of bypassing the elevator due to the line. But in retrospect, DON""T!!! The stairs up are time consuming and you will be coming down them later. We also missed the film regarding the castle :(

The view from the top was worthwhile. There was a photo shop set up with green screen for pictures with unusual samurai helmets. Yes were stopped.

This Castle is nothing like the BEST Castle...Himeji. But the outer stone walls, with their massive stones were worth the visit. It's exterior is beautiful! The interior is a museum. Personally found it rather dry but others loved it.

The castle sits on the most amazing park like site and can be accessed via a lovely public park with lots of locals enjoying the open spaces and kids playing.

If you have the chance...visit Himeji over this one.",Tripadvisor

"Muy bonito el castillo, bastante padre que es museo y puedes aprender algo sobre la historia del lugar y como hubo batallas importantes, algunos personajes y sucesos históricos. La vista desde el observatorio es muy bonita, sobre todo si el día está despejado, tendrás una vista 360° de la ciudad. Nosotros subimos por el elevador al piso 5 y solo por escaleras los últimos 3 pisos, recomiendo mucho esa opción para no cansarse de más, como quiera los demás pisos podrás visitarlos al bajar de regreso por la escalera, no te perderás nada y disfrutarás más la visita, porque los que iban por la escalera llegaban muy cansados y sin poder respirar al observatorio en el piso 8.",Tripadvisor

"We didn't go into Osaka Castle only walked around it and through the gardens as we had two elderly family members that couldn't walk up and down the stairs that well.
The castle is very photogenic although it isn't great where you can see the lift which has been added to the outside wall of one side of the castle. However, we found plenty of other vantage points to take some good photos. It was easy to get to using the JR Osaka Loop which we didn't have to pay any extra for as we had the JR West Pass.",Tripadvisor

"What an experience!! There are not enough words to describe the beauty of this attraction. We visited on a Saturday afternoon and the walk up to the castle was filled with families and visitors enjoying a nice afternoon, picnicking, socializing, and enjoying one another’s company. The cherry blossoming was vibrant and the weather was just right. We took a pleasant stroll up to the base of the castle and along the way, we saw some amazing things. Plenty of food vendors to choose from and being surrounded by the relatively quiet stillness of the moment was truly the highlight. This is a must-see experience for anyone visiting Osaka.",Tripadvisor

"We were in a guided half day tour and spent about 4 hours here. It’s quite a walk from the parking lot up to the courtyards.

You walk through a magnificent grove of cherry trees and get a great view of the moats and interlocking castle walls on the way in.

The castle tour itself is very informative. We walked all the way to the top to start the self guided tour and went to the observation deck first.

Great views of Osaka City and the castle grounds are fantastic from the top.

You can then walk your way down through 5 floors of history of the castle and the reign and consolidation of Japan from Hideyoshi Toyotomi.

Gift shop on the 8th and 1st floors.

Shops and restaurants are featured near the castle in a separate building.",Tripadvisor
"This place was our first touristic place in Osaka. The biggest castle in Japan that was built in the 16th century. Of course, this castle is a reconstruction of Tokugawa castle in the Shogun era which was ruined during wars.

It is located in a vast park surrounded by moat . It comprises of 8 floors. We got the tickets online to skip the line and the entrance fee for adults was Yen 600 and free for the chikdren below 15( ID required). The guide directed the tourists to the floor 5 in where we could find some animated events during the rule of Hideyoshi Toyotomi. It was worth visiting and interesting for my family too. Then, we went up through stairs to the upper floors. To me, the 8th floor was stunning as it had a panoramic view to the city above 50 meters. Then, at 2nd floor, we found a small line for wearing Samurai and kimono for men and ladies. We should pay Yen 500 for each along with a free picture.
There was another building near Osaka Castle so called Miraiza Osaka which was used as Japanese Army fourth Division in 1930 but now being used for café , stores and souvenirs.
My tip : for those who cannot walk long or face limited time , I recommend to get the internal small train which takes you around the park and castle and to castle as a final destination. The price for the ticket is Yen 400 per person for one way, meaning that for return, you should buy another one if you need it.
At the end, I recommend visiting this nice castle and to me is the first and best touristic site in Osaka.

It was Sunday and the areas around the castle were all very crowded, full of vibes and vibrancy. Despite that, the scenery and view here, of the castle buildings, surrounding areas over the castle lake/canal with lots of greenery, was serene and tranquil! It was as beautiful as before!

We didn't enter the castle as there was a long queue but did spend some time to roam the grounds and saw several last batch of ""autumn leaves trees"", yellow or orangish-yellow colour, its was spectacular. We even took photos with runners in costumes and they were very friendly too.

Although it was sunny, it was still quite cold with the winds blowing and do wear good walking shoes as you will need to walk up the slope or steps.

It was a good revisiting experience!

We visited the Osaka while staying in Osaka. The castle is beautiful! There are souvenir and cafes next to it. We didn’t go inside since we just visited the Himeji Castle the day prior. Definitely a must visit if you’re in Osaka.,Tripadvisor
"Castello perfettamente restaurato (o meglio ricostruito). All'interno un museo mentre all'ultimo piano è aperto e si ha la vista a 360 gradi sulla città. Disponibili ascensori ma c'è abbastanza fila, sono 8 piani in ogni caso. Il biglietto consiglio di farlo online perché si entra subito anche se si perde un piccolo sconto se si ha il biglietto della metro o treno.",Tripadvisor
One of the places of historical significance. The place is beautiful and serene especially in the morning. Lots of areas to pass through before reaching the castle itself.,Tripadvisor
"This is an attraction visited by many people. We went in the morning just as it opened. It is surrounded by a very beautiful garden and since it was Sunday, there were a lot of people running around the track. The castle is steeped in history and most exhibits have more than one language for the explanation. It got crowded as the day went on.",Tripadvisor

"Dit is echt de moeite waard, kost een paar centen en het is het meer dan waard. Het gebouw is zeer bijzonder omdat het aardbevingsbestendig gebouwd is en het uitzicht is prachtig. Let goed op de aanwijzingen, want je moet op de 3e etage een stukje rechtdoor lopen (het lijkt alsof dat een muur is) dan het bochtje om en daar is de rij naar boven. Er kunnen 18 mensen tegelijk in de lift dus dat gaat best snel. Kaartje voor het daadwerkelijke uitzichtpunt koop je uit de lift bij de ticket automaat",Tripadvisor
"The grounds are great to wonder around, the buildings and beautiful with history. Osaka castle is great to see on the outside.
Inside is like a museum gallery nothing like an ancient castle inside. Great views over Osaka from the top viewing area.",Tripadvisor
"Парк бесплатный, вход в сам замок платный и своих денег абсолютно не стоит, потому что внутри ничего особенно нет, но надо отстоять большую очередь. А вот погулять снаружи в хорошую погоду - очень приятно! Наверное, когда еще сакура цветет - то вообще невероятно!",Tripadvisor
"A nice view to see the town from the top floor of the Osaka Castle. In my opinion, it is a good destination to visit when you travel to Osaka, Japan.",Tripadvisor
Osaka castle is something I’d recommend if you have time. We went early in the morning when the crowds were quiet. I would recommend to buy tickets online before going. I would also recommend to take the stairs or you’ll miss the stops and museum on each floor. A lot of information and names but still good to experienced. The gardens around the castle are also beautiful.,Tripadvisor
"Bel posto , a piedi salire i piani e osservare ad ogni livello e’ interessante , fino ad arrivare in cima in cui la vista su Osaka e’ spettacolare , sopratutto al tramonto e prima di un temporale intensissimo che ci ha bagnati completamente … bell esperienza la corsa al taxi e il ritorno inzuppati di acqua",Tripadvisor
"Mettiamo pure in conto che, come scrivono i cartelli all'entrata, questa è la terza vita dell'Osaka-jo, che dopo essere stato edificato per essere inespugnabile nella prima metà del Seicento venne distrutto e poi ricostruito dallo stesso Tokugawa che lo aveva messo a ferro e fuoco, per poi cadere quasi nell'oblio (incredibile!) ed essere restaurato per intero solo nel 1931. Questo però non fa del castello né una pacchiana copia dell'originale, come tante se ne trovano in giro per il mondo, né un'attrazione secondaria. Perché non solo la forma del palazzo (molto simile a quella originaria) è comunque stupenda - e offre una bella vista sulla città dall'osservatorio all'ultimo piano -, ma ognuno dei piani è stato allestito ottimamente a museo della storia della guerra civile che nel Seicento scosse la città (e non solo), con preziose opere d'arte e ricostruzioni multimediali originalissime: scene teatrali riprese dal vivo, miniaturizzate e proiettate in una sequenza di schermi. Chi arriva qui senza sapere niente di scontri politici e battaglie di un'epoca che è stata cruciale per la riunificazione statale del paese, se ha pazienza, può piacevolmente venire a capo di quelle intricate vicende. Una citazione la merita anche il bel parco che attornia il mastio e in cui sono presenti un paio di templi. E' talmente grande che, a sbagliare uscita come ho fatto io, si è costretti a camminare per un buon paio di chilometri per riprendere la via del centro.",Tripadvisor

          This castle was built in 1583 by a Japanese Samurai Toyotomi Hideyoshi. The structure is built in a 1 square km ares on two raised platform. Theur are eight levels accessible by elevator on way up. From level 7 and 8 you can have a panoramic view of the Osaka city. The castle is surrounded by water filled section on all four sides.
      We visited this place during our recent Japan trip. The travel on Osaka metro Day pass was smooth. From the metro station a 10 minutes walk we reached the outer boundary. From there you can avail electric vehicle ride to the main gate ( ¥ 300 one way). We preferred walking to the castle which took about 15 to 20 minutes. Our Metro Daily Pass allowed us quicker access to ticket counter and we went to the 5th level. From there we walked upto the top level. Rhe view of the city  from the top was awesome. From there we had to walk down. Each floor has exhibits of Japanese and the samurai history, models pictures etc.
A must visit in a Japan trip to catch a glimpse of Samurai history.

"Tujuan pertama kami saat tiba di Osaka setelah chek in hotel adalah kastil Osaka. Kastil ini terletak di tengah Kota Osaka.
Untuk menuju ke sana bisa dengan menggunakan subway dan ada beberapa stasiun subway yang tak jauh dari kastil ini. Setelah keluar dari stasiun subway kita berjalan kaki menuju ke halaman kastil yang luas. Seperti kastil-kastil Jepang lainnya kastil ini dikelilingi tembok yang tinggi dengan parit di luarnya untuk pertahanan pada masanya.
Kami tidak masuk ke dalam kastilnya hanya berfoto dari luar saja. Cukup bagus, halamannya sangat luas pada musim sakura banyak pohon sakura berbunga, tapi kami ke sini saat musim gugur atraksi utamanya adalah pohon ginkgo yang daunnya berubah warna menjadi kuning.
Mungkin ini adalah salah satu atraksi utama kota Osaka selain universal studio japan dan dotonbori.",Tripadvisor
"Sehr schönes Schloss mit Museum. Achtung: Die Schlange für den Aufzug ist sehr lang (rechte Seite). Es empfiehlt sich, die Treppen zu nehmen (links halten). Das Museum erstreckt sich über mehrere Etagen und enthält viel Geschichtliches über Japan und Osaka. Die Infotafeln sind auf Japanisch und Englisch. Es gibt eine schöne Aussichtsplattform. Das Schloss ist nachts beleuchtet und der Zugang zum Park frei. Daher lohnt sich ein Abendspaziergang.
Linksseitig vor dem Schloss ist ein kleiner Teich, in welchem sich das Schloss spiegelt. Hier kann man sehr schöne Fotos machen. Wie alles Tourispots in Japan ist auch dieser sehr überfüllt. Man benötigt daher etwas Geduld. Am Abend waren wir allerdings fast alleine und auch bei Regen kommen deutlich weniger Menschen.",Tripadvisor
"The building is impressive, the grounds are peaceful, the museum entry was modest (600yen with children under 15 years of age free) and the exhibits are translated in English. The view from the 8th level was also quite good. However, I couldn't help but leave this place a little disappointed. Be prepared for an all new museum interior with lots of steep stairs with a few artefacts on display at each level.
Note - Leaving the train station, there's a great strip of restaurants to choose from before walking to the castle itself.",Tripadvisor
"宿泊した上本町から大阪駅行きの路線バス１本で行けました。
大阪城周辺にはJR・地下鉄の駅がいくつかありますがどの駅からも徒歩１０分以上はかかりそうなのでバスを利用しましたが、停留所からはやはり１０分以上要しました。
入場券売り場に並びましたが平日なのに入場券購入に２０分少々かかりました。並んでいるのは８割ぐらいが外国人、ここまで日本人率が低い観光スポットは珍しいです。
入場券を事前に入手している人は売り場に並ぶこともなく入場できていたので事前入手MUSTだと思いました。
それ程大型なお城でも無いので入場後は１時間もかからず館内を見終えることが出来ました。
お城近くにある土産品を販売している店舗内も外人だらけでいかにも外人が好みそうな商品だらけなのには驚きました。
ここは外人の聖地と言っても過言ではないと思えました。
一度行っておけば良いスポットというのが正直な感想でした。",Tripadvisor
Prachtig van buiten om te zien. Indrukwekkend als je aan komt lopen. Zo bijzonder naast alle neon reclame in Osaka dan dit kasteel. Van binnen niet zo bijzonder. Mooi uitzicht wel op de top,Tripadvisor
"Of course on the to do list when visiting Osaka to see an amazing piece of architecture and the gardens. We were there in autumn and the leaves were beautiful. We arrived at around 10ish and the place was very very busy, so busy that to get a ticket for the gozabune boat, the next available time slot was 1:30pm! Hence, get there as early as you can. The grounds are just beautiful and well looked after and the castle is just as expected. We had the Osaka Pass and were able to just walk straight in to see the castle and go up the top to see the view - well worth it - there were queues a few hundred metres long. The view from the top is mainly of the local suburb and the grounds, but worth it. Inside it was very busy with people and hot and claustrophobic and you cannot take photos either, hence we probably missed some of the displays inside because of this as we just wanted to get out of there. We did buy a few things from the shop inside though. We entered from the gate closest to the gozabune boat area as we thought we could get on the boat first thing - I still think this is the best way to get there and then exited via the JR station gate through a park. The grounds are free to enter and it seems as though many locals and their dogs go there. Great experience despite the crowds and the photos are amazing.",Tripadvisor
"Не ждите очереди на лифт, по лестнице норм все проходится. Вид с 8 этажа портит решетка. В целом познавательно. Фотографировать нельзя, но если очень хочется то можно.",Tripadvisor
"What a stunning castle! It's a long walk from the car park to the castle but it's definitely worth it. The area in front of the castle was full of cherry blossoms when we went and lots of Japanese families were celebrating and having picnics under the trees.
The castle itself is very interesting inside and we spent quite a while looking at the artefacts. It has a lift, which were able to use as I have a bad knee, that goes up to the top floor to see the amazing views.",Tripadvisor
"Pretty awful.it is a castle rebuilt in 19th century, of very little historic interest. I felt inwasted an afternoon venturing here and would rather have read a book",Tripadvisor
"A small castle with many stairs, it provides history information but not much of original view.
There are lots of walking so be prepared. Better to buy online ticket to save time on queue",Tripadvisor
"Crowds are ridiculous, be at gate by opening time at 9am and if you haven’t pre-bought a ticket be ready to wait 45 minutes. With pre bought tickets you get in within 10 minutes. The stories are great but you will need a lot of time understanding the lineage and battling clans. To truly enjoy and be educated at least 2 hours",Tripadvisor
"I used the following hacks to expedite my visit of the Castle:

1. Order the Entrance Ticket for the Castle online. Cost is 600 yen or about $3.88. Credit cards can be used to pay for the ticket. Get the QR code or print it if your foreign phone does not work in Japan. Show these at the Entrance and proceed to enter. Benefit= you skip the long lines and start your visit soon.

2. Public Transports: Use the Metro System. If not sure, ask the Station Staff and the locals. They are very helpful.

3. IC card - I bought the Icoca card when I arrived and loaded it with 2,000 yen. It can be used for local trains, buses, Metro subways, trams, grocery stores. Just tap it at the gates and off you go. Other types of IC cards are ok too.

From the Osaka Station, I took 1 short train ride and then transfer to another Metro Line. Very short rides, then walk to the Castle for about 15 minutes, going through the Park.

4. Elevator: It goes directly to the 5th Floor. Then one has to walk via the stairways to the 6th, 7th and 8th floors to see their exhibits.

5. If not interested in climbing up the stairs, another techinique is to visit each floor on the way down, starting on the 5th Floor. There are interesting exhibits on every floor. My favorite one is where I tried wearing the Samurai heavy helmet and vest plus a sword. Of course, great photo shoot here!

6. Use the shuttle to go back to the entrance of the Park if your legs are feeling tired/ feeling hot. Cost is 300 yen or about $2. Conserve your energy for visiting other attractions of Osaka.",Tripadvisor
"The Osaka Castle is the most famous landmark of Osaka. It was built in the year 1583, destroyed many times due to war and fire and rebuilt over the years, the last one in the year 1931.

It's normally very crowded and difficult to enter inside to view the museum. Atleast half day is required to view the castle properly.",Tripadvisor

"台東区浅草の随一の観光スポットである「聖観音宗浅草寺」についての情報を発信していきます。「浅草寺」を訪れたのは2023年7月1日です。
「浅草寺」を観光するには、「雷門」がスタートの起点となります。ちなみに、「浅草寺」の境内には、「雷門」、「仲見世」、「宝蔵門」、「本堂」、「五重塔」、「影向堂」、「薬師堂」、「淡島堂」、「銭塚地蔵堂」、「二天門」、「伝法院」、「鎮護堂」、「弁天山」などがあり、そして、「浅草寺」の一部として、少し離れた場所にある「駒形堂」、「待乳山聖天」、「遍照院」などもあります。さすがに「浅草寺」は歴史あるお寺なので、見るべき名所・旧跡は山のようにあります。まずは、「雷門」までのアクセスです。「雷門」へは、次の四つの方法で行くことができます。それと「雷門通り」の反対側には、「浅草文化観光センター」があり、コンシェルジェがいて分からないことがあれば、丁寧に説明してくれ、「浅草寺」以外の観光情報や美味しい名物料理のお店なども紹介してくれます。
①　東京メトロ銀座線「浅草駅」1番出口から徒歩1分110ｍです。東京メトロ銀座線「浅草駅」の1番出口を出ると正面に大きな「雷門通り」、右側に「ファミリーマート」があります。出口を出て右折し90ｍ直進すると右手側に「雷門」があります。
②　都営地下鉄浅草線「浅草駅」A4出口から徒歩2分150ｍです。都営地下鉄浅草線「浅草駅」のA4出口を出て右折し60ｍほど進むと正面に大きな「雷門通り」があります。そこを左折し、50ｍ直進すると、信号(表示名：「雷門」)があります。そのスクランブル交差点を渡れば、「雷門」は目の前です。
③　東武スカイツリーライン「浅草駅」から徒歩3分270ｍです。東武スカイツリーライン「浅草駅」は2Ｆにあります。改札口を出たらエスカレーターを降り直進すると右手に信号があります。信号を渡り左方向に進むと「神谷バー」が右手にありますので、横断歩道を渡らず右折し140ｍ直進すると右手に「雷門」があります。
④　つくばエクスプレス「浅草駅」Ａ1出口から徒歩8分500ｍですつくばエクスプレス「浅草駅」Ａ1出口を出てそのまま「国際通り」を65ｍ直進します。すると「雷門通り」があります。「浅草寺(360ｍ)」、「浅草公会堂(500ｍ)」の看板があるので、左折し450ｍ直進すると左手に「雷門」があります。
次に、「浅草寺」の歴史を紐解いてみると、「浅草寺」の始まりは、飛鳥時代の推古天皇36年(628年)まで遡ります。「檜前浜成」、「檜前竹成」兄弟が、「宮戸川」（現在の「隅田川」）で漁をしている最中に、投網の中に一躰の仏像を発見しました。「檜前浜成」、「檜前竹成」兄弟は、像を水中に投じ、場所を変えて何度か網を打ちましたが、そのたびに尊像が網にかかるばかりで、魚は捕れませんでした。「檜前浜成」、「檜前竹成」はこの尊像を持ち帰って土地の長である「土師中知」に見せたところ、その仏像が「聖観世音菩薩」の尊像であることが判明しました。「土師中知」は、私宅にその尊像を祀り寺にしました。こそが「浅草寺」の起源とされています。「浅草寺」は、1,400年近い歴史がある都内最古のお寺であるがゆえに度々の災難に見舞われました。平安時代の長久2年(1041年)の大震災、承暦3年(1079年)の火災等により被害を受け、その都度修復されてきました。寛永19年(1642年)には、門前町家の失火から「浅草寺」は再び焼失してしまいますが、その7年後の慶安2年(1649年)に再建された「浅草寺本堂」は、関東大震災の被害も免れ、約300年間無傷を保ってきました。しかし、昭和20年(1945年)の東京大空襲により、「本堂」を含む境内一帯が甚大な被害を受けてしまいました。その後、昭和26年(1951年)から始まり昭和33年(1958年)に終了した再建工事によって、現在の姿となりました。また、「浅草寺」は、霊験あらたかな寺として、「源頼朝」や「足利尊氏」、「徳川家康」などの名だたる武将が祈願に訪れました。現代でも多くの人に親しまれ、国内外から毎年3,000万人以上の参拝者が訪れます。
まず、「雷門」は、観光のメッカである浅草のシンボルです。高さが3.9m、幅が3.3m、重さが約700kgもある「雷門」と書かれた「大提灯」が吊るされ、いつも沢山の人で賑わっています。もちろん日本人ばかりでなくワールドワイドな人々が訪れて来ます。その「大提灯」前でインスタ映えする写真を撮ろうと多くの観光客が入れ替わり撮影しています。「雷門」は、「浅草寺」の「総門」で、「雷門」という名前は実は通称で、正式名称を「風雷神門」といいます。また、迫力満点の「風神像」と「雷神像」は「大提灯」の両脇に安置されています。これなら邪気も恐れおののいて「浅草寺」に近づけませんよね。「浅草寺」の護法善神で、風水害を除け、伽藍を鎮護するために祀られました。ここで注目して欲しいのが、「大提灯」の裏側に描かれている見事な龍の彫刻です。真下から覗く龍は迫力満点で、事前に調べたのでしょうか、写真を撮っている観光客も多く見られました。「雷門」から入る際には、作法があります。「合掌一礼」をしてから境内に入るようにしてください。
次に、「雷門」を抜けた先に続く「仲見世通り」には、飲食店やレトロな和雑貨店、おもちゃ屋さんなどさまざまなお店が立ち並び、賑わいを見せています。また、「仲見世通り」の両側には裏通りがあります。表通りに負けないくらいユニークで興味を引くお店があります。表通りが混雑している場合には、裏通りを通行するとストレスなく「本堂」に行くこともできます。
「仲見世通り」を抜けると朱色の楼門の「宝蔵門」が現れます。この門はもともと「仁王門」と呼ばれ、左右には4m超えの「仁王像」が安置されています。左側が口を開けた「阿形像」、右側が口を結んだ「吽形像」で、どちらも木曾檜造りです。重さはなんと約1,000kgあります。眼力が強く迫力があるので、ぜひ足を止めて見てみてくださいね。「宝蔵門」は、天慶5年(942年)武蔵守平公雅が建立したとされています。「旧仁王門」の再建で､昭和39年(1964年)にホテルニューオオタニの創業者である「大谷米太郎」が寄進しました。その功績をたたえて浅草寺本堂の裏手には昭和42年(1967年)に「大谷米太郎夫妻」の銅像が建立されました。現在、残念ながら工事中で幕に覆われ見ることができません。「雷門」の仁王像に一歩も引けをとっていません。それどころか私見ですが、「浅草寺」のガーディアンであるこちらの仁王像の方が迫力満点で見ごたえがあると思います。両方の像はインドの古代武器を持っており、これならどんな悪魔でも退散させることができますね。この仁王像は、身体健全や災難厄除の神として信仰を集めています｡そして、真ん中には、「小舟町大提灯」が吊ってあります。これもまた「雷門」の大提灯に負けず劣らずです。「小舟町大提灯」は、日本橋魚河岸信徒の心意気を示したもので万時2年（1659年）に奉納したことに始まり三百年以上の歴史と伝統を今に連綿として受け継いでいます。このような守るべき伝統があるからこそ「浅草寺」は、時代はかわれど、いつの世でも万人の心を惹きつけいるんですよね。ちなみに前回は、江戸開府400年にあたる平成15年(2003年)10月に新調し奉納されました。そして、「宝蔵門」の裏側に回ってみると巨大なわらじ吊るされています。仁王像にでさえ大きすぎるわらじです。とにかくこの巨大なわらじを履けるのは、進撃の巨人くらいだなと思いました。解説板を読んでみると、このおおわらじは「高さ4.5m」、「幅 1.5m」、「重さ500kg」、そしてなんと藁を2,500kgも使用しています。山形県村山市有志より平成30年（2018年）10月奉納されました。ちなみに８回目の奉納だそうです。わらじは仁王さまのお力を表し、「この様な大きなわらじを履くものがこの寺を守っているのか」と驚いて魔が去っていくといわれているそうです。進撃の巨人ではなかったですね。失礼しました。それと「宝蔵門」には、あの鎌倉殿で有名な北条政子が伊豆修禅寺で悲運の最期を遂げた長男頼家の追善供養のため、中国から取り寄せて鶴岡八幡宮に奉納したもの全5428巻所蔵されているそうです。「宝蔵門」でのポイントは、「宝蔵門」付近には、このわらじと東京スカイツリーを一緒に撮影できる絶好の撮影スポットがあります。
次に、「本堂」にお参りする前に、しなければならないことがあります。それは、本堂右側にある「お水舎」(手水舎)で身を清めることです。中央の龍神像の口から受けた柄杓一杯の水で、すべての作法を行うのがポイントです。
手順１…右手に柄杓を持ち左手を清めます。
手順２…左手に持ちかえて右手を清め、
手順３…再び右手で柄杓を持ち、左手で水を受けます。その水で口をすすぎ清めます。
手順４…柄杓を立てて柄に水を流してから元に戻します。
という流れが正式な作法です。ちなみに「お水舎」の中央で威圧感を放つ像は、「高村光雲」作の水を司る「龍神像（沙竭羅龍王像）」です。「お水舎」でのポイントは、天井を眺めてください。そこには、「東韶光」により天井に描かれた「墨絵の龍」があい、かなりの迫力で、隠れた見どころとして知られています。
「お水舎」でみを清めた後に行うのが、「本堂」前にある「常香炉」でお香を供え、煙を浴びて邪気を払いましょう。供えられた線香の束からもくもくと煙が立ち上がる煙を浴びると体の悪いところにかけると治りがよくなるといわれています。大きな屋根のおかげでお香の火が消えず、雨の日でも変わらず煙を浴びられます。「線香」は、本堂向かって右の「授香所」で購入できます。そして、ここでのポイントは、線香の束には「卍（まんじ）」の印が入っているのでチェックしてみてください。
一連の儀式を済ませ、いよいよ浅草寺「本堂」へ足を踏み入れます。「浅草寺」の「本堂」はご本尊の「聖観世音菩薩」を奉安することにちなみ、「観音堂」とも呼ばれています。「本堂」に入ったらお参りの作法は、お賽銭を入れ、合掌して一礼、さらに軽く一礼となります。山門から出る際は、本堂に向かって合掌一礼をします。くれぐれもお忘れないように！そして、「本堂」の正面には、圧倒的な存在感を放つ直径4.5mの「大提灯」と向拝の聯があります。ちなみに、「雷門」の「大提灯」は高さ3.9m、「宝蔵門」の「大提灯」は高さ 3.75mです。「本堂内」は「内陣」と「外陣」に分けられています。「本堂」の中に入ると、天井まで約10mの開放的な空間が広がっていました。ここで注目して欲しいのが天井中央に描かれた「川端龍子」の画による「龍之図」とその左右が「堂本印象」の画による「天人之図」の約19畳分の「天井絵」です。そして、江戸時代の参拝者は天井を見上げて天人にも祈願していたそうです。また、正面上に「施無畏」と書かれた「扁額」が掛かっています。これは、大正から昭和にかけて活躍した天台宗の僧侶であり書道家の「豊道春海」の筆によるものです。ここまでが「外陣」の見どころです。次に、靴を脱いで畳敷の「内陣」に上がると、その中央にはご本尊を奉安する「御宮殿」があり、その内部にお厨子が安置されています。「御宮殿」の左右には「梵天」と「帝釈天」の立像が安置されており、ご本尊の脇侍として内陣右奥に「不動明王」、左奥に「愛染明王」が祀られています。また、「御宮殿」背後の裏堂の中央には「観世音菩薩」（通称：裏観音）が安置されています。ちなみに「浅草寺本堂」のご本尊は、「秘仏中の秘仏」といわれています。「本堂」には、本来あるはずのご本尊の姿はありません。その理由は大化元年(645年)まで遡ります。「勝海上人」というお坊さんが「浅草寺」に立ち寄り、「観音堂」を修造しました。ある夜、上人の夢に観音さまが現れて「みだりに拝するなかれ」と告げられたそうです。以来、本尊は「厨子御宮殿」の奥深くに、秘仏として奉安されています。「絶対秘仏」となっているため、たとえ僧侶であっても姿を見ることはできません。毎年、12月13日の「御宮殿開扉法要」のときに限り、一般の信徒も見られるのですが、それは「本堂」のご本尊ではなく「御前立本尊」です。「御前立本尊」は「浅草寺」の中興とされる「慈覚大師円仁」が作ったとされる像です。昼間の景観も美しい「浅草寺」ですが、夜にはまた別の表情を見ることができます。毎日、日没から23:00までの間、「本堂」、「五重塔」、「宝蔵門」、「雷門」がライトアップされ、昼間とは違う幻想的な没入感を味わうことができます。
参拝後は「本堂」近くに戻って「お守り」を購入するなり、「おみくじ」を引いてみましょう。「おみくじ」は、100円を入れて、木製のおみくじ棒が入った筒箱をふり、1本の木の棒を引くとそこに番号が書かれています。同じ番号の引き出しを開けると中に「おみくじ紙」が入っています。もちろんご存知でしょうが、おみくじの種類はよい順に「大吉」、「吉」、「半吉」、「小吉」、「末小吉」、「末吉」、「凶」の7種類です。これは噂ですが、「浅草寺」のおみくじは「凶が多い」というらしいです。
また、「御朱印」は、神社仏閣巡りが好きな人にとって、「御朱印」の収集は楽しみのひとつですよね。「浅草寺」の「御朱印」は、本堂に向かって左手にある「影向堂」でいただけます。「御朱印」は「ご本尊」と「大国天」の2種類（各500円）です。
「浅草寺」には、「本堂」や「影向堂」以外にも注目のスポットがたくさんあります。参拝後は「浅草寺」の境内にあるお寺や名所・史跡などをのんびりと巡ってみるのも楽しいものですよ。
まずは、「本堂」の左手にある天空にそびえ立つ朱色の「五重塔」です。その高さはなんと53.32mでビルに例えると15~20階建に相当します。下から見上げると首が痛くなります。日本の歴史的な建造物である「宝蔵門」と「五重塔」や「浅草寺」と「五重塔」のツーショットは、見ごたえ十分でもちろんインスタ映えもします。真下から「五重塔」の一番高い部分の「相輪」を見上げるとやはりその高さには驚かされます。江戸時代には、「上野寛永寺五重塔」、「芝増上寺五重塔」、「谷中天王寺五重塔」とともに「江戸四塔」として人々に親しまれたそうです。現在の「五重塔」は太平洋戦争の時の東京大空襲で一度焼失し、昭和48年(1973年)に再建されたものなので、比較的新しくその朱色の荘厳な建物は目を引きます。しかし、本来の「五重塔」は、「本堂」に向かって右側に建立されていました。現在その場所には「旧五重塔跡」の石碑が建っています。塔最上層の第五層には、「聖仏舎利」が奉安されています。「聖仏舎利」は、昭和41年(1966年）3月18日、スリランカ国のイスルムニア寺院より正式に請来されたものです。また、第二層から第四層には信徒の休憩室や寺務所などもあります。そして、塔の一番下は、塔を囲むように作られた塔院になっています。塔院には一室ごとに一体の「観世音菩薩像」があり、全体では計100体の「観世音菩薩像」があります。その周りには信者たちを供養する位牌が置かれ、その数は現在では1万個以上とされているそうです。残念ながら「五重塔」の中には、永代供養等している方など一定の条件があり入ることができません。
次が「淡島堂」です。「淡島堂」は、「浅草寺」の「本堂」に向かって左手にあります。「淡島堂」で特に興味をもったのは、「天水桶」と「胎内くぐりの灯籠」です。まず、本堂前の「石灯籠」です。これは、「胎内くぐりの灯籠」として江戸時代から有名なものです。子供がこの灯籠の下をくぐると、虫封等になると伝えられています。確かに、「石灯籠」の穴は見たところ小さな子供が一人やっとくぐれるような穴の大きさでした。次が「本堂」です。「本堂」前には、「浅草寺」を語るうえで重要な「天水桶」があります。何故この「天水桶」が重要かと言うと、実は、太平洋戦争中の昭和18年（1943年）11月18日に、この「天水桶」内にご本尊さまをお厨子ごと奉安し、「本堂」の地中深くに納めたため、ご本尊さまは戦火を逃れたからです。もし、この「天水桶」がなかったら現在の「浅草寺」の運命は如何にと言うことですね。そして、本尊の「阿弥陀如来像」、「淡島明神像」などが安置されている「淡島堂」は、女人守護のお堂です。「淡島明神」という俗称があり、江戸時代には「淡島明神」の信仰を説く「淡島の願人」と呼ばれた人がいたそうですよ。
次が、「銭塚地蔵堂」です。「銭塚地蔵堂」は、「淡島堂」の奥にあります。境内には赤字に白で「銭塚地蔵堂尊」と書かれた旗が沢山あるのですぐ目につきます。また、建立されたばかりでピカピカな本堂なので見逃すことはないでしょう。「銭塚地蔵堂」の歴史は、江戸時代享保年間まで遡ります。そして、そこには「浅草寺　銭塚地蔵堂尊」と関係の深い民話が残っています。その民話と言うのが、摂津国有馬郡（現在の兵庫県西宮市）に山口某という武士の妻がおり、夫とふたりの子供と暮らしていました。貧しいながらも彼女は武士の妻としての誇りを失わず、他人からの援助を断って清貧の生活を送っていました。その暮らしは、武士の妻としてプライドを失わないため自分の髪の毛を切って売るほど生活に困窮していたそうです。ある時、子供らが庭先に埋まっていたたくさんの寛永通宝を掘り当てました。しかし彼女は、理由のない金を自分のものにするのは恥と考え、金を埋め戻させました。この賢い母に育てられ、子供らは立派に成長し、家が繁栄したので、子供らは金を埋めた場所に地蔵尊を祀ったと言われています。これが現在、西宮市山口町に残る「銭塚地蔵尊」です。この地蔵尊の御分霊を勧請したのが「浅草寺」の「銭塚地蔵堂」で、商売繁昌のご利益を求めて祈願する人が沢山います。「銭塚地蔵堂」は、関東大震災で、木造、瓦葺の堂宇は焼失したものを令和元年（2019）11月再建（鉄筋コンクリート造り）しました。できたばかりで果たして御利益はあるのかなあ思いましたが、社務所の脇の所に「カンカン地蔵」なるものがありました。多くの人が参拝したせいか、その姿がほとんど原型をとどめていないかわいそうな石像です。もとは「大日如来像」だそうですが、現在は「カンカン地蔵」と呼ばれています。お参りの人が石で打って祈ると「カンカン」という金属音がすることがその名の由来になっています。塩を奉納して祈願すると財福のご利益があるといわれています。しかし、「カンカン地蔵」は全く原形をとどめていません。その理由というのが「削った粉を持ち帰ると、お金に困らない。」という言い伝えが昔からあったからです。白い塊になっているお姿を見ていると、ご自分の身を削って人々にご利益を与えてこられたのだなと感慨もひとしおでした。「塩」をお供えすることから「塩なめ地蔵」とも呼ばれているそうです。
次は、「二天門」です。「二天門」は、「浅草寺」の境内にある「東門」です。「馬道通り」から入ると「二天門」が正面にあり、そして「浅草寺」へ通じる一番近い門です。そして「二天門」の両側には、四天王のうちの二体、「持国天」と「増長天」を安置しています。このことから「二天門」と名付けられました。どちらも鎌倉時代以降に流行した「寄木造」という複数の木材を組み合わせる技術で造られています。元々は「浅草寺」の境内にあった「東照宮」を守るための守護神像（随身像）を安置した「随身門」として創建されましたが、明治時代の神仏分離によって、「広目天」と「持国天」の像に入れ替えられました。次が楽しみにしていた「二天門の大提灯」です。「大提灯」が架かっているはずでしたが、ついてないというか、残念ながらありませんでした。「大提灯」といえば「雷門」のシンボルとしてあまりにも有名ですが、実は「浅草寺」の中の「雷門」以外にもあります。「浅草寺」にあるのは本堂の「志ん橋大提灯」、宝蔵門の「小舟町大提灯」、鳥居の東側にある「二天門大提灯」の３つあります。何故見たかったかと言うと、「二天門大提灯」は周辺の数回にわたる戦災をまぬがれた唯一の「大提灯」だからです。そして「二天門大提灯」は重要文化財に指定されています。「二天門」は、境内に残る江戸時代初期の貴重な古建築として、国の重要文化財に指定されています。
最後は、「弁天堂」です。「浅草寺」の本堂の南東、「宝蔵門」の右手側にある小高い丘は、「弁財天」を祀る「弁天堂」が建っていることから「弁天山」と呼ばれています。石段15段ほどで登れる小さな丘です。「弁財天」は池中の小島に祀られることが多のですが、「浅草寺」の「弁天山」もかつては池の中にありました。現在、池は埋め立てられて「弁天山児童公園」となっています。「弁財天」は七福神のなかの唯一の女神です。「弁天堂」のご本尊は白髪であるため、その見た目から「老女弁天」と呼ばれ、全国でも珍しい「弁財天」となります。座った姿で、甲冑をまとい、右手には長い剣を持っています。剣を帯刀する像容をもつことから武家の信仰がひときわ篤く寄せられていたようです。この「弁財天」は神奈川県藤沢市の「江ノ島弁天」、千葉県柏市の「布施弁天」と並んで「関東の三弁天」として有名です。「弁天堂」に向かって右手に鐘楼があり、そこに掛けられている鐘は「時の鐘」です。「時の鐘」は元禄5年（1692年）に五代将軍徳川綱吉の命により改鋳され、江戸の市中に時を告げていた鐘のひとつです。深川に居を構えていた松尾芭蕉が「花の雲　鐘は上野か　浅草か」という句を詠んでいることでも推測できます。また、戦時中、多くの寺の鐘が供出を余儀なくされたなかで、「弁天山」の「時の鐘」は特に由緒がある鐘ということで残されました。現在も毎朝6時に役僧によって撞かれており、大晦日には新年を告げる「除夜の鐘」が鳴らされます。
まだまだ、たくさんあり紹介できませんが、他の寺院、名所・旧跡については、単体でトリップアドバイザーに投稿してありますので、ご覧いただければ幸いです。

"観光で初めて訪れました。見た目のカッコ良さ、眺望と展示それぞれを両立させ、観光施設として申し分のないお城であると感じました。見学順路としてまずはエレベーターで5階まで上り、8階の展望台までは階段で上りました。展望台では風が強かったですが眺めがとても素晴らしく、360度のパノラマを楽しめました☆大阪城ホールを見下ろしたりと、ここでしか楽しめない景色があり訪れて良かったなと思います。

景色を楽しんだ後は、天守内部の展示を見ながら下の階へと下りていきました。各階ともに展示内容が非常に充実していて、見応えある内容でした。お土産売り場では品揃えが良く感じました。唯一残念に感じたのは、外国人観光客も含めてあまりにも人が多いことです。現時点ではまだ色々なことが考えられる状況のため、居辛く感じて長居は出来ませんでした。",Tripadvisor
Recommend going before the shops open or after they close to avoid the large crowds. It is a very popular site for tourists and easy to get to in the heart of Tokyo. It is free to visit,Tripadvisor
"Die Tempelanlage ist sehr schön, aber obwohl wir im Juli da waren, war die Anlage völlig überfüllt! Evtl. ist es früh am Morgen besser.",Tripadvisor
東京の最も人気のある観光スポットで、浅草に行かなければ東京に来たことにならないくらいです。東京で最も古い寺院である「浅草寺」を中心に、浅草は江戸時代には東京で最も繁盛していた通りでした。アジアで最も先進的な大都市である東京の中で、東京で数少ない江戸下町の雰囲気を保っているのは非常に珍しいです。浅草へ到着すると、まず目に飛び込むのは有名な赤い提灯「雷門」です。その奥には表参道「仲見世通り」が続きます。,Tripadvisor
暑かったので上まで登るのはどうしようか悩んだのですが、京都の代名詞ともいえる清水寺は行く価値があると思い、汗だくになりながらのぼりました。結果、テレビなどでは伝わらない上からのすばらしい景色を眺め、清水寺の外観や境内も楽しむことができました。今度は涼しい時期にのんびり行きたいです。,Tripadvisor
"Si vous faites un peu de recherches sur Kyoto, vous devez lire que c'est devenu un enfer. Je n'irais pas jusque là, mais c'est clair qu'on y croise beaucoup de cars de touristes et que le Kiomizudera est une de leurs principales destinations. Il faut donc se faire violence et y aller tôt (7h pour nous)... ça a aussi pour avantage d'éviter les très fortes chaleurs de l'été (le parc est frais... le temple moins !). C'est par contre un incontournable.",Tripadvisor
"Kedua kalinya ke sini. Tempat yang wajib dikunjungi di Tokyo. Kuil di area area old town di Tokyo. Di area menuju kuil banyak penjaja makanan dan suvenir.
Kuil ini di daerah asakusa taito Tokyo. Dapat dicapai dengan menggunakan subway.

"日本有数の観光地である浅草雷門は、浅草寺参詣の入口に当たる「総門」で、正式名称は「風雷神門」だそうです。そして、「雷門」と書かれた赤い大提灯底の「龍の彫刻」も必見！また、「雷門」から「宝蔵門（仁王門）」まで両側にお店が続く約250ｍの仲見世通りは、下町情緒溢れる日本最古の商店街のひとつ。平日にもかかわらず、インバウンド増もあってか、半数以上が外国人観光客で、これまで幾度か訪れましたが、自由に歩けないほど参道が埋め尽くされる最高の人出でした。それでも今回は線香を購入し、本堂前の常香爐で香炉から立ち上る煙をいただき、本堂で無病息災を祈願してきました。

"This was my second visit, it is a really good place to see and get fortune told. Lots of history here and a good place for street food, although the souvenirs are probably not even Japanese, it is easy to find something to take home.",Tripadvisor
"Culturally unique and scenically beautiful there is nothing quite like a holiday to Japan. Alongside soaring skyscrapers, and neon lights, treasured ancient traditions like the graceful geisha, and the art of the tea ceremony still hold their place in daily Japanese life. Amongst the history and religious shrines, you’ll find modern cities, meet the politest people you are ever likely to encounter, dine on delicious local delicacies and discover why Japan continues to be a ‘must visit’ destination.

During our 12-day best of Japan trip we had the chance to see some of this amazing country’s best highlights at a leisurely pace. During the tour, we have visited some of the country’s best-known attractions and cities, such as Tokyo, Mount Fuji, Kyoto and Hiroshima.We visited not one, but two of Japan’s most famous gardens, ride the famous bullet train, learn to make matcha tea and had an opportunity to stay in a traditional Japanese Ryokan in Sendai.",Tripadvisor

"È stato il primo tempio che abbiamo visto arrivando in Giappone, è altamente suggestivo, sia di sera che di giorno. Al giorno è costellato di mille negozietti che vendono soprattutto cibo e souvenir, l’accesso al tempio è facile ed economico. Di sera il tempio è chiuso ma si può comunque andare a cercar fortuna mettendo una moneta nella scatola e pescare un biglietto che indica sia in giapponese che in inglese se sarai più o meno fortunato.

"This impressive castle sits in the middle of a large park and was a short walk from the Osaka Jokoen train station on the JR rail loop line.
There are three queues to get in depending on whether you have to buy an individual ticket, a group ticket or if you have already purchased an online ticket . We had purchased online and you can do so three months in advance and there is no date restriction so this is recommended. We also recommend getting there early. It opens at 9am and we were in the first lift up to the castle. Otherwise you may be faced with lengthy queues or climbing eight floors of steps.
The inside was very modern which meant the steep stairs were well made, but the interior felt like a modern museum, and not what we were expecting of an authentic castle. Up on the top floor was an excellent observation deck with three hundred and sixty degree views of the city. From here you can also see the tiled roof and the scrolled motifs depicting carps and tigers.
Spread across four floors was the castle museum with a range of items on display. There were some nice screen prints often depicting various historical battle scenes and military techniques. There were two suits of samurai armour and a long spear with mother of pearl inlay and a fivelock, which at the hands of a master shooter helped settle a castle assault by taking out the critical defenders in five shots.
Overall an excellent site.",Tripadvisor
"everything was really nice and the place is beautiful. love the little koi pond and their decorations as well

when i went there it was raining but there was still a ton of people walking around. be careful of umbrellas especially due to the amount of people but overall nice experience one just needs to be aware of the crowd",Tripadvisor

A beautiful and nice castle. It’s tooooo big and huge area and u could just spend hours for sight seeing and walking around.

Consiglio di acquistare il biglietto online sul sito del Castello! Occhio alle giornate di forte caldo e agli orari. Fila interminabile e sinceramente non la trovo così wow. Due piani su tre non si comprende nulla! Una serie di video e qualche teca. La foto al piano di sopra vale forse l'attesa? Mah io lo sconsiglio. Attenzione anche a mettervi nella fila dell'ascensore sennò buona fortuna con le ripide scale!!!. Voto 7 giusto per qualche foto! Il Giappone può fare molto ma molto di più (visitate ad esempio il Tempio d'oro!),Tripadvisor
Fun experience seeing one of the most beautiful structures in Japan. The museum is well done. They have floors that nicely show the history of the castle and the area. All the exhibits include English but the movies and 3D art do not. Be sure to get your tickets online. You can get them when you are there easily and you’ll save A LOT of time.,Tripadvisor
電車站出來後只要五分鐘就可以到達。若是四月初造訪，沿途還可以欣賞櫻花美景。進入園區後也有簡易的導覽說明，可用英文溝通。若不進去天守閣，也可以選擇搭船遊玩周遭環境，整個大阪城算是值得一去,Tripadvisor
I found the exterior of the building impressive but it did not match the interior. The view from the top (8th floor) was very good but unless you are into history and they do this well on each floor then I would only suggest you do this castle if you have some spare time.,Tripadvisor

"The Osaka Castle is magnificent from the outside from all vantage points. The 360 degree views of the city from the top level are spectacular. However, the inside of the castle is a museum that appears rather monotonous.
The moat around the castle in the gardens is a highlight. Although the gardens did seem a tad untidy when we visited.
Book your tickets online through Klook (600 yen per adult) to avoid the long queues paying to get in.
If required there is a lift to take you to the top. But you’ll have to queue up for the privilege.",Tripadvisor

"We came here around midday, and queues to buy tickets were incredibly long (so I suggest booking in advance). The castle looks brilliant and also has a nice park surrounding it. The building has around 9 floors, most floors are teaching you about history there, and one floor which has an outstanding viewpoint of the city. Note that there are 2 floors which don’t allow photography. The castle is located in a great area with loads of restaurants and some museums nearby.

今年は桜の開花が早く、久しぶりに大阪城へ出かけました。海外からの観光客も多くなり天守閣の登城口は長蛇の列。天守閣から桜の大阪城公園を見たかったけれど、なにもこんな日に登城しなくてもとお堀からお城を見る事にしました。その昔秀吉も乗ったであろう鳳凰丸を再現した御座船でお堀めぐり。舟に乗って日本一の高さを誇る石垣から天守閣を見上げると迫力満点､流石によじ登って攻めようとは思わない。石垣には魔除けの人面石や普請を担当したそれぞれの大名の刻印を探すのも楽しい。桜の下を暫しクルーズし、戦国の世に想いを馳せる。,Tripadvisor

"Siamo stati in visita a Tokyo Disney 4 giorni, di parchi ne ho visti davvero tanti e questo mi ha lasciato a bocca aperta, non tanto per le attrazioni davvero spettacolari ma per la sua tematizzazione, e davvero incredibile, credetemi che nei giorni di alta affluenza quando c'e tantissima gente camminare anche solo per il parco per vedere le tematizzazioni e fantastico. Il parco e piuttosto grande, vederlo tutto in un giorno e praticamente impossibile, e diviso in varie aree tutte molto belle e iper curate. Da non perdere assolutamente viaggio al centro della terra e Indiana Jons, già solo queste 2 meritano un entrata quì, per non parlare poi di Toy Story e la mitica Hollywood Tower, insomma c'e ne per tutti i gusti. Gli spettacoli sono belli, quello che merita di più ovviamente e Fantasmic alla sera e il festival di Pirate Summer se andate in estate. Parco super consigliato, se siete amanti della Disney e dei parchi tematici questo parco dovete assolutamente visitarlo.",Tripadvisor

"Deers are everywhere, from the streets to temples and grass landscapes.
Droppings are also everywhere, but the locals are sweeping it up when they see it.
Dont get too concern with stepping on them.
Apparently i went during the mating season; where they may be more aggressive than what you have read in reviews, but everything seems normal... they are still aggressive.
Somehow those bigger deers with antlers are more docile than the younger and female ones. You feed one, then u have another 5 butting you, nipping on your legs and waist. I almost have to run at times.
Just raise up your turning hands to mimic that you do not have biscuits or food, it works!
Overall it is an experience!",Tripadvisor
"Fácil acesso após uma pequena caminhada pela Sanjodori street a partir da estação de Nara. Parque com muitos templos (Todai -ji, mais conhecido e visitado), lagos , museus e principalmente cervos, que se alimentam de pequenas bolachas de arroz que são vendidas por 200 ienes. Local com muitas trilhas com barracas que vendem de tudo um pouco, souvenirs, takoyaki, bife de Kobe, sorvetes. Passeio muito legal para uma tarde inteira.",Tripadvisor
"We were on a cruise excursion and had no opportunity to change our plans. We were warned that Mt. Fuji is often ""shy"". Mt. Fuji was seen in the morning from our cruise ship but by the afternoon when we arrived at the 5th station, the clouds completely obstructed the views. At the 5th station, there are lots of shops (selling the usual souvenirs from China) and restaurants and is the start of the hike for Mt. Fuji. Even if we didn't see the mountain, we could say, we stepped on Mt. Fuji.",Tripadvisor
"We’re glad we did it, but it was sadly underwhelming. An expensive day out and a long trek from Tokyo (2 hours + each way). We had good weather so got to station 5 which is closest to Mount Fuji. On the flip side, because of the time of year, there was no snow on top or cherry blossoms. A few souvenir shops at station 5. Not over crowded. Tick box exercise (sorry!)",Tripadvisor
We enjoyed the hot springs at hotel price Yen $3000 to rent a room and facing Mt Fuji to relax our vacation but we drove 2 hours from Tokyo to see best scenery.,Tripadvisor
"It is an awesome experience, not only for my boys, but also for the parents! We are lucky we have a very informative tour guide who informed us on what to and not to do with the deer in the park to avoid aggressive behaviors of them. If you feed them, they will surely gather around you, but they are trained too. Just show them that you have empty hands, and they will leave you alone. They were, so far, very friendly with us. We definitely had a lot of fun!",Tripadvisor
"The deer here were VERY aggressive towards my children, they kept ramming them and knocking them down. One knocked my 3 year old son by the nub of a horn (they had already de-horned these creatures) and flung him through the air like a football. I hope that my children aren't traumatized from this experience, and I will be having them evaluated by a therapist for PTSD upon their return to the states.",Tripadvisor
"Очень красиво, сюда имеет смысл приехать на 3-4 часа для неспешных прогулок (естественно, не летом, потому что в жару здесь неуютно будет). В парке есть несколько храмов, и главное развлечение - олени, которых можно и нужно кормить печеньями, которые приобретаются тут же. Олени выпрашиают еду, кланяясь туристам)) Однозначно рекомендую!!",Tripadvisor
"I always imagined deers to be too uptight and ready to flee upon sensing the presence of people, but these deers made me appreciate them up close, so friendly. Be careful though feeding them, because once a deer gets a piece of acorn or deer food, the rest would gang up on you, crazy.",Tripadvisor
Unlike other park..this park is a home of hundreds of deer. You can feed the deer by buying a biscuit which cost you 200 yen..however don't be afraid..since you hold the biscuit a lot of deer will coming to get the biscuit instantly..the park is clean..if you continue to explore the park you will find the todaiiji shrine which you will find a buddha statue. Nice place to visit..,Tripadvisor
"Very crowded, but still well worth a visit. Do take a guide and make time for the garden. It will take at least 3 hours to see everything at a reasonable pace. Be prepared for the crowds and the fact you might be forced to wait at times for others to go through.",Tripadvisor
"Walked about the eight ponds formed from the melted snow of Mount Fuji at Oshino Hakkai in the Fuji Five Lake region, located between Lake Kawaguchiko and Lake Yamanakako. The melted snow filters down the mountain through porous layers of lava for over 80 years, resulting in crystal clear spring water that is revered by the locals. Took a 45 minute cruise on Lake Yamanakako to witness stirring panoramas of Mt Fuji. Woke up in the morning from our Hotel Regina Kawaguchi to an amazing view of Mt. Fuji.",Tripadvisor

Never again Viator",Tripadvisor
"We had a few hours available one day of our trip and were trying to decide between this and a few others. We ultimately decided to go here since we never visited an Imperial Palace before but had gone to castles, shrines, temples, etc.
I will say it was very interesting and very cool to see but personally we like castles and shrines better.
It was a large complex and many structures to see, the gardens were very nice, but it's been rebuilt and you can't go in.",Tripadvisor
"Original plan was to ascend to the 5th Station of Mount Fuji, at elevation of 7545 feet, then cable car to the summit. Unfortunately the government closed the roads due to unsafe conditions. To switch gear, we were able to get a spectacular view of Mount Fuji from Oshino Village on a crystal clear early February morning. Here we also had the opportunity to see couple of furnished historical Japanese houses. Additionally within this area were natural springs/ponds. Local food venders sold roasted sweet potatos, strawberries, takoyaki and mochi on skewers & meat on skewers. There was also a bakery where they sold freshly baked senbei which shouldn’t be missed.",Tripadvisor
"Free English tours 10 am last about one hour. Entrance is at Seishomon Gate. No advanced reservation required. Each person has a headset to hear the guide. This was especially important as it was pouring rain the entire time. One can also walk around on one’s own, but a guide is imperative to know what you are viewing as signage is greatly limited. You don’t enter the palace, but you see some rooms from the outside looking in. You wait for the group to assemble for your given guide in a large waiting room. Different groups for different languages wait there. There are free lockers there for your belongings.",Tripadvisor
"With JR rail pass we saved a 4 hour return bus trip from Tokyo and picked a day to travel shikansen to odawara, with good weather and a place nearby with cherry blossom in full bloom in February. Catching local trains is easy and then you have the flexibility to choose your own itinerary. Finally after a previous trips we got some perfect views. Make sure you are aware of the weather before booking and check your dates. I got caught with booking the next available a month later not knowing that trip advisor was indicating all sold out for weeks when in fact this was wrong through other booking agencies.",Tripadvisor
"This is a great day out from either Kyoto or Osaka. The deers are free range however they seem to hangout in one area near the bus station. We had a 6 month in tow, handy to know the bus station has a full baby feeding area. Great fun, just watch little ones around the deers at all times. Temples are great here. (Side note, when we got off the train it seemed like a lady tried to hussle us a “guided tour”. Easily shutdown and unusual for Japan)",Tripadvisor
"It's quite a distance from the nearest train station. And it's all gravel to the palace, which is pretty difficult to walk on. It's ok if you are only interested in looking at the external structures coz you don't get to go inside to look at the rooms and the decor. Overall, I probably spent 10 to 15 mins coz you just go croynd the building structure, and that's the whole of the visit. The only saving grace is the garden in the palace.",Tripadvisor

"We had 6 adults from our family who wanted to climb Mt Fuji a few days ago. We stayed nearby the night before . We arrived at the 5th station parking lot around 5:30. The bus ride up took around 30 minutes or so. We started our climb at 6:45 am. Only two of our group made it to the summit. We are all healthy adults of various ages. This is not for people who are scared of heights or who can't walk at a very steep incline going up and down. There are multiple sections of rocks and boulders you have to climb or crawl over. It is NOT easy ! It's also not a hike, it's a climb. We did use can air, took breaks and we still didn't make it back down in time for the last bus at 6:30 pm. There is a turn around path around the 8th station that 4 of us took while the other two continued to the summit. The path down is no easy task! We ended up calling a taxi . Cost was about $150 for 6 of us to drive us to the parking lot. Everyone has to make the choice as to if they are ready for this climb. I suggest watching You Tube videos and DO NOT let anyone tell you it's easy and that anyone can do it.",Tripadvisor

"Last time I was in Japan was in the summertime and the fallow deers (daim in French) had bright white spots (deers don't have the spots). This time, in January, we could barely see the spots. From nice gentle creatures, they are now emboldened by tourists giving them food. If not fast enough, they will try to steal your bag, whether it contains food or not. They are in many parks on the main route to the big Bouddha.",Tripadvisor

"This is the centre piece of Nara as its among many of famous tourist attractions. Its close to the bustops from the Station and very close to the Todaiji temple and the start of the walk to the Kasuga shrine.
Its got a lot of kiosks on the side but its main attraction is the deer which walk around unmolested. They are quite used to tourist food and can be quite aggressive.I was butted by a stag for no particular reason! They are all quite dirty as though outdoors its not really a forest.",Tripadvisor
"One of the very best hiking experiences! It is definitely a hard hike and you need to have some fitness to do the hike up and back in a day, but it is definitely possible. We did it without all the hiking equipment in about 7.5 hours up and down. It was about 4hr 40min up and then about 2hr down. Coming down was actually when hiking boots would of been really helpful, as it was so slippery. The other really helpful thing was having a climbing stick (I got a used one for half price from a 'used stick' bin inside one of the shops at the fifth station).

It takes about an hour to get there by bus from Kawaguchiko Station and if you are planning to do the hike in one day it is best to get a bus that arrives at the fifth station by about 8am or 830am. To give yourself enough time to climb up and back you need to make sure you start the actual walking by 9am. The reason for this is the last bus back to Kawaguchiko Station leaves Mount Fuji 5th Station at 1820 (620pm), if you miss this bus, you will be staying overnight on the mountain or getting a very expensive taxi.

It is best to bring your own drinks and a light backpack. Do not bring anything too heavy. Bring food like energy, candy bars etc. You can buy stuff along the way at the other stations on the way up. There is also toilets. There is nothing on the way down. You can climb in light clothing and a t-shirt, although a wind and waterproof jacket is good for the top of the mountain. Also suggest you take some anti-inflammatory tablets incase of cramps as the route up is hard on the legs (it is not climbing, it is hiking - but steep hiking).

This is a hard hike and not suitable for the overweight or very young children. You will need to be able to hike 20km... this is the distance we did. Coming down is very slippery and like walking on marbles in places - it is likely you will fall at some stage coming down and get covered in dust, if not wearing hiking boots, your shoes are going to be pretty destroyed (like mine were).

This is one of the very best hiking experiences I have ever had and highly recommend.",Tripadvisor
"Just a short walk from the train station. The deers roam free in and about the park, even on the road. They are pretty friendly but be aware not to agitate them. Walk through the park to get to other attractions.",Tripadvisor
"Im glad we did go here. We were greeted by lots of deers. We didnt buy the cookie though but they still came and greeted us with a bow. Fun to watch them rest, mingle and even snatch your bag 😜 The backdrop view was great too. This is the nicest park Ive been so far",Tripadvisor
"We had the 7-day JR Pass and took the Yamatoji Line from Tennoji Station to Nara Station.
It was a fair distance to Nara Park, so we opted for the Nara city Loop Bus, 1-day pass, which was a good decision, for 500y. You'll need to wait at Bus stop No.2. Walk out of Nara Station building and seek the locals' advice on where Bus stop No.2 is located. They'd be most willing to guide you.
There was a long queue, but it moved fast. The bus dropped us at Nara Park, which was so convenient.
We saw lots of deers roaming around. A few approached us leisurely. One, in particular, came up to us and began to sniff at our bags and pushed his nose against our bodies! One of my sisters was squealing in fright.
We didn't buy any crackers to feed them because we had the earlier experience at Miyajima Island, where they more you feed them, the more aggressive they become.
There were many people around, taking pics, and patting the deers. They seemed very tame here.
It was drizzling, the ground was wet and we had to use umbrellas. After taking some satisfactory pictures, we decided to take the city loop bus to see the rest of Nara city, while the younger ones in our group continued on to visit Todaiji Temple.",Tripadvisor

"Climbing Mount Fuji in just one day was a remarkable feat. As I ascended, I was surrounded by a diverse group of climbers of all ages, creating a unique sense of camaraderie. The friendly exchanges of ""Konnichiwa"" along the trail added to the charm.

"I brought my brothers here during New Year's Eve and the park was packed full of people. The entire area was filled with festival stands selling amazing street food like grilled octopus, Kobe beef steak on a skewer, okonomiyaki, yakisoba, etc. There were tons of deer relaxing in the main thoroughfares, but most of them seemed a bit overfed as they were completely uninterested in the deer crackers that I bought. The ones further out in the less populated areas were more receptive in eating them. We never encountered any of the more aggressive deers though. All of them appeared completely used to being petted constantly. One of my co-workers suggests trying to feed them blueberries, but I never had the opportunity to verify if they like to eat them or not. All in all, it's a great day trip from Osaka.",Tripadvisor
"I know its surprising but you dont have to buy the biscuits, the deers will come to you regardless and let you pat them. If you have biscuits they will go crazy because they love the biscuits and do anything to eat all of the ones you have, so dont buy them! we didnt we spent 3 hours here and pat so many deers, and ones sitting near us and just laying in the sun.
We saw so many moronic tourists get jumped on/rammed because they were teasing the deers.
The poor deers are so food motivated but they cant help themselves and they become agressive, so remove the problem - biscuits - and then you're safe! easy fix.",Tripadvisor
"This location looked so charming! It is not.

1. I petted a deer, and got deer mites on my hands. Mites are not dangerous but I wasn't sure what they were, and wound up going to an Urgent Care in Honolulu and dermatologist (just to make sure the first doc was correct). I hadn't petted a deer since I was 10, and yielded to temptation - don't touch the deer!

2. The deer are aggressive. I had no food on me, and no explicit scent, and a deer came up from behind and pushed me with its head. Deer weigh a lot and I was startled - and frightened.

My husband bought the crackers and fed the deer. They gathered around him rapidly, which can feel overwhelming. However, what WAS overwhelming was that one deer took ahold of his pants below the knee. Fortunately, it let go, but that was not a pleasant experience.

I would never take a child near these deer. We saw kids teasing the deer with food - do the parents realize the risks?

There appeared to be no town officials providing advice or anything else.

If you want to go to Nara - they do have some lovely museums, stay away from the deer. They are NOT Bambi.",Tripadvisor
奈良公园是个占地很广的开放式公园。有成百上千的野生梅花鹿，好多人拿着鹿饼喂。我记得当时好像是300日元一捆小鹿饼。鹿鹿们非常现实，在它吃完你手中的鹿饼，它就会立刻马上，并不多呆一秒，就走。所以，要拍照的，一定要抓紧时间和它合照！！,Tripadvisor
"The walk uphill from the train station through narrow streets does not prepare you for the expansive Nara Park, full of beautiful gardens, shrines lakes and of course the deer. We were marginally early for the cherry blossoms but there were still lots of beautiful plum blossoms. When you buy food for the deer from one of the many vendors, keep it out of sight and feed isolated individual deer. Otherwise you will be ""mugged"" and pushed around by numerous deer that forget their manners and have no intention of bowing for their reward. The Todaji Temple is also worth seeing.",Tripadvisor

It took us less than 2 hours to reach this amazing place. From there we have perfect view on the Fuji mountain. A bit too early to enjoy the cherry blossom. Try the street food, everything is good !

From there we took the train to go to the Kawaguchi lake and then another bus to reach our last view point. We walked a bit back along the lake and it was great (weather, view). If you can stay one night in this region, I would recommend to try and spend more time to discover all the wild area.

桓武天皇が平安京に遷都され明治維新までの天皇のお住まい。当初は今の二条城の北西辺り(千本通り)にありましたが、元弘元年（1331年）から明治2年に明治天皇が東京に移られるまでこの場所に。度々の火災などで安政2年(1855年)に再建されたのが今の京都御所。幕末から明治維新まで孝明天皇、明治天皇と王政復古の大号令、小御所会議、五箇条の御誓文の発布と幕末歴史ファンにはたまらない歴史的な舞台になった場所。紫宸殿には天皇の御座「高御座」皇后の御座「御帳台」があり即位の礼では皇居に運ばれました。清涼殿の横に「滝口」の看板が。ここで天皇を警護したのが滝口の武士、平将門が有名ですね。京都御所は今は予約なしで無料で拝観できます。無料のガイドもありますが、パンフレットや音声ガイドアプリもあるので、ゆっくり自分のペースで散策出来ました。ただ京都迎賓館はネットで事前予約が必要で有料です。幕末が好きな方には京都御苑の蛤御門もおすすめです。禁門の変で長州藩と薩摩藩・会津藩が戦った場所で当時の弾痕が門や柱に残ってます。ちなみに通称の蛤御門とは普段は閉じられている門が天明の大火の時に開いたため蛤に例えられたとか。,Tripadvisor
"Visite gratuite de cet espace.
Avec un peu de chance vous pouvez joindre un groupe pour une visite guidée également gratuite et tomber sur un guide très sympathique et parlant un très bon anglais.
Les bâtiments sont impressionnants mais ce sont vraiment les anecdotes du guide qui apportent l'intérêt pour comprendre les portes, l'orientation des bâtiments, les traditions ancestrales et celles beaucoup plus récentes.
Dommage que l'on n'ait pas pu aller à l'intérieur de ces bâtiments.",Tripadvisor

"Mt. Fuji has always held a top spot on my bucket list, and on my first visit to Japan, I was disappointed to miss out. Determined not to let it slip away again, I wasted no time in booking our trip as soon as we arrived this time around. Our journey to Mt. Fuji commenced at Shinjuku station, where we boarded a bus for the two-hour journey to Honshu.

Driving towards our destination, the majestic silhouette of Mt. Fuji greeted us, instantly setting the stage for our adventure. Though we didn't attempt the summit climb, the sheer presence of the mountain filled us with a profound sense of awe and respect.

Exploring the surrounding villages and scenic trails, we stumbled upon charming cafes, traditional ryokan inns, and secluded shrines, each offering a glimpse into Japan's rich cultural tapestry. The children were enthralled by the sights and sounds of the countryside, embracing each new discovery with wide-eyed wonder.

Upon reaching Lake Kawaguchiko, we were welcomed by its tranquil waters and picturesque surroundings. While there, we visited a couple of shrines, adding a touch of spiritual reflection to our journey. Exploring the lakeside promenade and verdant gardens, we encountered serene sanctuaries and breathtaking vistas at every turn.

In addition to the awe-inspiring natural beauty, Mt. Fuji boasts several must-visit attractions:

Chureito Pagoda: A renowned spot offering breathtaking views of Mt. Fuji against the backdrop of the pagoda.
Fuji Five Lakes (Yamanakako, Kawaguchiko, Saiko, Shojiko, and Motosuko): While we managed to explore Kawaguchiko and Lake Saiko, all five lakes promise picturesque views of Mt. Fuji.
Fujisan World Heritage Centre
Oshino Hakkai: A delightful village featuring eight spring-fed ponds and traditional thatched-roof houses.

As for transportation, our original plan to use the bus that takes you around, however, this was thwarted by overcrowding and lengthy ticket queues. Opting for a private car hire proved to be a more efficient and flexible choice, allowing us to navigate the area with ease and maximize our exploration without the constraints of bus schedules.",Tripadvisor
だいぶ前は予約が必要だったみたいですが、今は普通に予約なしで見学できます。一応簡単な手荷物検査はあります。中の建物についてのパンフレットも入ったら用意されていてわかりやすかったです。庭園なども含めて流石の美しさでした。,Tripadvisor
"Nos costó encontrar el lado por el que se entra, tuvimos que ir bordeando hasta dar con el. Es más uno de nosotros sin querer por las afueras se acerco a la pared y tener cuidado porque suena una alarma hasta que te alejas.
Lo bueno que tiene ver el palacio es que la entrada es gratuita, y puedes verlo tranquilamente o hay visitas guiadas gratuitas que duran unos 50 minutos, en japonés y inglés.
Algo que no nos gustó es que todas las estancias están cerradas, el recorrido es únicamente por afuera, así que si vais tenerlo en mente que no podréis ver nada del interior solo las estructuras y jardines.
No lo vemos una visita obligatoria, ya que hay muchos otros lugares más bonitos, eso ya también depende de el gusto de cada uno. En el caso que dispongáis de tiempo entonces si.",Tripadvisor

"「二条城」を見学した後、地下鉄東西線「二条城前駅」から地下鉄烏丸線「今出川駅」まで10分。下車後は徒歩5分程です。入場無料ですが荷物検査があります。
「京都御所」は、明治維新まで天皇の住まいであり、桓武天皇が奈良の「平城京」より「長岡京」を経て、794（延暦13）年に「平安京」に都を遷されたのが始まりです。昭和天皇までの即位の礼は「京都御所」で行われましたが、平成以降は皇居の宮殿で行われています。
令和への改元の際に使用された「高御座（たかみくら）・御帳台（みちょうだい）」は、大正天皇即位式に際して製作され、大正・昭和・平成・今上天皇の即位の礼で使用されました。現在は「紫宸殿」に保管されています。40年程前に訪れた時は、「紫宸殿」の近くまで行けましたが、今回は近寄ることが出来ず残念でした。",Tripadvisor

"What can you say about Mount Fuji? It holds a mythical place in Japanese hearts and when you see it for yourself you can see why. We caught our first glimpse of it on the Shinkansen (Bullet Train) to Hakone from Tokyo and were lucky enough to see it throughout our visit to Hakone park. I've seen some pretty good mountains, Vinicunca (Rainbow Mountain) in Peru for example but I think Fuji might just top my list a number one.",Tripadvisor
"Mt Fuji is one of the iconic and must-see destinations in Japan. My wife and I visited it recently as part of a Wendy Wu Tour to Japan and weren't disappointed. We were originally expecting to get the the 5th Station but the road was closed due to the lower snow-line, so we had to make do with the 4th Station. Not really a problem as the viewing conditions are very similar. While the visit was spectacular, the best part of Mt Fuji is actually not going up it at all. At the 4th Station, it was like being up any large, snow covered mountain in that you can really only see so much of the actual summit itself (i.e. very little). That all changes when you go down to the lower lakeside area (some kms away) where the views are spectacular, as expected. The day we were there, the cloud was minimal and at a distance of some 10km, it was postcard perfect. So, the best way to see Mt Fuji proper is from a distance - not on it. Highly recommended.",Tripadvisor
"Нара - древняя столица Японии, где до сих пор сохранилось множество старинных Храмов, которые оставляют неизгладимое впечатление. Олени здесь - это полноценные жители города. За ловлю или нанесение вреда которым, вам грозит штраф в размере 300 тыс йен или 5ти лет заключения в тюрьме. В парке их очень много, они свободно бродят среди людей, переходят дорогу перед автомобилями, которые их любезно пропускают, охлаждаются под кондиционером рядом с магазинами сувениров, а главное, едят с вашей руки. Кормить оленей можно только специальными крекерами, которые продаются на каждом шагу в парке. Стоимость таких вкусняшек - 200 йен (июль 2023 г.). Если вы отдали все крекеры, которыми хотели поделиться, то покажите животному обе ладошки, тогда они понимают, что у вас ничего нет. В противном случае, олени будут просить ещё, могут обнюхать вашу сумку или даже попытаться её забрать)) всюду висят предупреждения о том, что нельзя гладить детёнышей, т.к. впоследствии мать не сможет распознать его запах и откажется его кормить. Помните, что эти олени не домашние, а дикие животные, которые просто привыкли к людям вокруг, поэтому, если животное почувствует угрозу, то может и проявить агрессию. Предупреждения об этом находятся на входе в парк. Но не пугайтесь, пребывание в парке и общение с оленями - это прекрасное впечатление для взрослых и детей!",Tripadvisor
"It was really fun to feed and pet the deer and see them bowing. We took the Kintetsu line train to Nara, although there is a JR train further away, and it was only a short walk from the train station before the deer started coming around. There are stands set up around the park perimeter that sell biscuits so that you can feed the deer. If you don't have food and you want them to stop bothering you, just show them your empty hands. They will nip at your clothes and crowd you if they think you have food. We saw deer as far as the Todaiji temple - they were everywhere!",Tripadvisor

"Famous destination in Japan @ allows interaction with deer that roaming freely in the park. Nara is only 45mins away by train from Osaka. Park is 5mins walk from Kintetsu Nara Stn or about 20mins from JR Nara Stn. Strange as it may seemed, Nara's deer will gather in group without bothering the Deer crackers vendor. They will wait eagerly for visitors to feed them. The deer are surprisingly tame/timid, but can be aggressive when teased or provoked during feeding time.Fantastic and great place to explore/stroll leisurely. Great place for families and travellers alike. Due to Nara's hooved inhabitants, there aren't many places to get food in the park.(It's huge....) Finding food in this huge park is going to be a mean feat !",Tripadvisor
"Nearest station is Nara then take bus number 2(get of at todaji temple) which cost 220 yen then walk 300 meter otherwise walk 1.5km from train station. Suggest to take bus there then walk back when finish as after that can enjoy the stroll and look around the area which have quite a number of food and shopping options. Advise to bring a small plastic bag/trash bag so when you brought the biscuits to feed the deer(200 yen) you can open up the packaging then pour everything in and hide inside your pocket otherwise there a chance of clothes being bitten(saliva), head butt and swarm by a crowd of deer.",Tripadvisor

La promenade permettra de découvrir bien des temples dans cette ville agréable, mais je déconseille de sortir les 200 Yens qui permettent de les nourrir.

Si vous voulez envoyer des vidéos amusantes à vos familles - et perdre un peu votre dignité - vous pouvez tenter le coup, mais très honnêtement ça fait mal.",Tripadvisor
We spent an hour at the park feeding the deer. There were more than 40 of them gathered around the corner. There are two Nara stations - JR Nara and Kintetsu-Nara. Kintetsu-Nara is the closest and is only 5 mins walk from the park. Kintetsu-Nara can be accessed from Namba in Osaka. You can get a 1-day Kintetsu ticket which gives unlimited rides.,Tripadvisor

"We went to Nara deer park from Kyoto . A day trip it was. The deer park and the deers were a good experience. However , what really appealed and was fascinating is the Todaiji temple across the park ( you will find many deers there as well). An old temple originally built around 738 AD . This is a must see for its architecture. It is huge and massive and not to be missed .",Tripadvisor
"This park with its bowing deer is worthwhile visiting! The weather conditions were not the best but the rain and clouds added to a fairy look which made it beautiful all together. The deer are very much used to people but beware, those animals are still wild animals and not domesticated at all. The park can get very crowded, even in the pouring rain…",Tripadvisor

"Our group stopped for lunch and to see the deer in Nara. It was a midpoint between Osaka and Kyoto. The deer, young and old, are all over the place. The older ones learn how to bow to ask for food. A package of crackers for the deer can be bought at the adjacent shops for 200 yen. However, if you feed it, then it will follow you.
We attended an outdoor food festival in the park. There are many food vendors -- Taiwan lady selling dim sum. I bought fresh persimmons which are in season now.
We waited and listened to an Edo period performance by singers. It was too slow-moving, it was hot, and the speaker was so close to me. Just sitting under a tree and watching the interaction of visitors with the persistent deer. The deer look so docile but can be very aggressive.",Tripadvisor

Es verdad que hay ciervos y puedes darle de comer, acariciarlos etc pero sin más. Nosotros en nuestro planning hemos programado un día entero para ir a Nara pero con un par de horas, se puede ver de sobra a no ser que quieras ir a los tiempos.

They showed us parts of Tokyo we didn’t know about. Mt Fuji is pretty but the other sites felt a bit more spectacular. As it was a little cloudy that day(mt Fuji) wasn’t so visible.

"I booked a bus tour out of JR Shinjuku leaving at 7:40am. Arrived at 5th Station (2305m) on YOSHIDA route entrance. I left extra clothes for next day at the locker, keeping my back as light as possible. Yes, you can buy many stuffs on the mountain (even beer and sake). You must to have 100 yen coins handy to use bathroom (200yen) each time.

We start going up around 12pm, arrived Lodge HAKU UN SOU (3200m) around 5:30pm. I was guided to a bunk bed which was well structured to keep my personal belongings. The dinner was served immediately. Since this was not my first rodeo, I was curious with their service. Oh well..

I dose off less than 30 minutes and start getting ready to go up at 1am. We all left the lodge at 2am heading to the top. We arrived top around 4:30am, just in time to see the perfect sunrise.

It is definitely worth the trip but this is not an easy hike. I saw a guy sleeping under stones but I am sure that he has to change his plan as it gets really freezing in the night. There were many trashes left behind the trail. Also, the last part of the climbing is very steep and narrow. There were many people folding the line behind. Hmmm…",Tripadvisor

"We recently had an amazing hike on Mt.Fuji. Weather was beautiful, beautiful view, had lots of fun stamping my trekking pole on the way and it was also achieved in one day, going from Tokyo to Fuji and back to Tokyo again, on the same day.
I was looking to see if this was possible prior to our climb, but couldn't find anyone saying they had done, so here is a little guide on how we did it.

In easy steps:
- Bus from Shinjuku at 7:55 to Subaru 5th station. Arrived 10:30.
- Ascending to the summit. This took us about 4 hours + 35min break at the top.
- Descending to Subashiri 5th station. This took us about 2 hours 15 min.
- Going back to Tokyo from Subashiri 5th station. The latest bus leaves at 18:45. Express bus to Shinjuku, Tokyo from Gotemba station.
OBS!: Be aware of the similarity of the two 5th stations on Mt.Fuji. Subaru 5th station is NOT the same as Subashiri 5th station. Follow signs carefully depending on which station you are aiming for:)

And a bit more detailed..

We started our day at our AirBnb in Shinjuku. We were lucky to book here as there are direct express busses leaving for Mt.Fuji right from Shinjuku. Reservation can be done from this page:
https://highway-buses.jp/course/Fuji-5th.php
We went for the bus leaving at 7:55. See timetables for all on-season (climbing season) busses going to and from Fuji on this page:
https://www.japan-guide.com/bus/Fuji_season.html

After arriving at Subaru 5th station I bought a trekking pole, some water and then I was fit for fight! We started the Yoshida trail (the trail going from Subaru 5th station) a bit over 11:00.
The trek up was beautiful. We were very lucky with the weather as it was just some clouds on the sky this day. We started slowly and steady up, as this is a general good tip when hiking a mountain in this altitude. It's always tempting to push a bit going up a mountain, but this is not recommended and had to be re-learned on this hike.

My older brother did the hike to the top in about 3 hours, which is an amazing time ascending this mountain (Norwegians has no chill). The rest of us got there in about 4 hours of hiking. Climbing in altitude can be really harsh, so again, slowly and steady is key. 4 hours is also quite fast.

After 35min of relaxing and some warm coffee from the wending machines on the top of the mountain (yes😂), we decided to head back down again.
The trip down went much faster and we got to Subashiri (be careful to follow the right signs if this is the station you are aiming for) in a about two hours and fiftheen minutes.

Quite tired, going back to Tokyo, we did the bus 18:45 from Subashiri 5th station. This bus took as to a parking spot, where we again had to do a transfer for another bus that took as all the way to gotemba station. From Gotemba staion we did an express bus going back to Shinjuku and boom, Tokyo -> Fuji -> Tokyo in one day! On googling it says that it is possible to take a bus from Subashiri 5th station straight to Gotembaeki and the to Shinjuku. Will leave the itinerary as an image to this post. We had to do a transfer to another bus to get to the station. There was indeed a tourist information guide at this station. He was very helpful and helped us plan this trip back. Be sure to ask him if help is needed.

All in all a super nice trip! A must do in Japan!

Other take-aways from the trip:
- We were lucky with the weather being nice. Make sure to pack warm clothes, gloves, a hat and good shoes in the case of bad weather. (Checking the forecast is a good idea).
- This hike can be quite challenging. Would not recommend following the trip that we did if you are not sure you're in quite good shape. The time schedule is a bit thight, but also do-able. We took our time. Did not even think about time, and still we made it to the last bus from Subashiri. But we have lots of experience hiking in Norway.
- Going during weekends was not recommended due to big crowds.

Hope this was helpful!",Tripadvisor

Used Fuji Mountain Guides for our trip to the summit - can’t recommend them enough - they were amazing!!!! The climb is tough but so rewarding!! Our guides looked after our group so well without at any point feeling like a tour group - there were over 30 of us and they had a guide at the front and guide at the back and guides in the middle so everyone was always safe yet could climb at their own pace - they were all lovely knowledgeable and helpful - if you want to climb Fuji - use Fuji mountain guides!!,Tripadvisor
"Es un amplio parque que tiene puestos de comida en algunos tramos, donde en algunos puedes comprar comida para los ciervos sagrados que viven allí, donde es su hogar. Se pide que si se les da de comer, sea de esta manera, para que no les siente mal la comida. Te van a seguir y saludar si creen que llevas comida. Son algo muy curioso de poder ver y tocar a un ciervo de manera tan natural.

En el parque también está uno de los templos más famosos de Japón, el Todai-ji. Recomendamos ir tanto al templo como al parque.",Tripadvisor

"We visited Nara whilst staying in Kyoto to see the deer. They were so tame and placid eating the deer biscuits out of your hand. We found the ones at the south park of the park near the shrines and museum very tame in comparison to the ones in the north open part of the park- they were very pushy!
I would definitely recommend this as part of your stay, particularly if you want to do something a little different",Tripadvisor
"We spent a wonderful afternoon wandering through the park surrounded by the gorgeous deer.

The atmosphere was calm and tranquil and feeding the deer their rice cakes was an absolute privilege. They are so gentle, even the ones who like to remind you that they’re there are not out to hurt you, they just want to give you a nudge to remind you that they’re there.

We’ll definitely be back.",Tripadvisor
"One does not need to worry about a deer encounter when visiting Nara Park, there are literally hundreds of them wandering around.

Most of them are primarily interesting in extracting deer biscuits from guests, packets of which can be purchased for 200 Yen a time. The deer bow when
Approaching visitors to hope to persuade them to give them a biscuit.

It is very endearing although it can be slightly tense when multiple deer surround you and you are running out of biscuits!

There are warning signs about the usual dangers of wild animals but the deer were encountered were very friendly.

A unique and awesome experience.",Tripadvisor
"You might come to Nara to see the Todaiji temple and it's well worth it. You start by entering Nara Park and you can't miss the deer.
They are incredibly tame and will bow their heads for you in anticipation of getting a piece of a deer biscuit that you can purchase onsite. I know you think they might bite but they just want the food. However, they will nibble at your pockets or purse or anywhere you might have stored the biscuits. Nara Deer are hungry, and this is not their first rodeo. They’ve seen tourists like you come and go all day. The deer want you to get to the important part of your tour. Please feed me!
In most cases, the deer will bow their head and indicate they wouldn’t mind a bit of cake. The problem comes from the herd mentality and when there is cake, more deer will join you. I had deer nipping at my jacket and my pants pockets. I had to show my open palms when I was done with deer biscuits so the deer could look for other sources of food!

"Um dos locais mais incríveis que visitei no Japão. Além dos fantásticos templos e belos jardins, a principal atração sem dúvidas são os veados que interagem com os visitantes. ´Você pode alimentá-los e interagir com eles.É uma experiência inesquecível!",Tripadvisor
"I came here in January 2020 with my girlfriend, and Nara was on our list just for the Deer, we didn't go anywhere else(although we probably should have). you can feed the Deer crackers that you can buy from vendors that cost about 200 yen a pack. Be careful though, they can disappear really quick! my advice is to break them in pieces so that you get more. There were a lot of tourists when we went. but there were plenty of deer just hanging around so you can easily get a deer to yourself... or 10. i would recommend this place to anyone staying close by!",Tripadvisor
"Be very careful around the deer. One bit my daughter and while it didn't break skin, left a large bruise. She was not teasing nor tormenting the deer in any fashion, nor did she have any deer biscuits at the time. Another deer took a nip at me also, but only managed to bit the keys in my pocket.

The signs tell visitors to hold their hands up to the deer to show that you don't have any food for them, but this doesn't seem to work.

There are plenty of other attractions in Japan where you won't be at risk of physical harm from the animals.",Tripadvisor

Para empezar, hay cientos de venados simpaticos y traviesos en completa libertad, con los que puedes interactuar y darles las galleticas especiales que venden por todos lados. Ni trates de ocultarlas porque las localizan de inmediato y te jalan el pantalon o falda hasta que se las das.

"近鉄奈良駅から徒歩で興福寺へ。公園入り口付近でさっそく鹿の群れがお出迎え。何はともあれ、おばちゃんがやっている鹿せんべいの店でせんべいを買うといきなり鹿たちに密着して囲まれ、身動きが取れない。せんべいの束をとられまいとばんざいの姿勢で立ち止まっていると、あいたっ！おしり噛まれた🥲後で別の店のおじちゃんに注意されたのだけど、立ち止まるとおしり噛まれるのだそう。最初のおばちゃん、教えてくれよお！コツとして強引にでも鹿たちを引き連れて前進しつつ、こっそり束をポケットかどこかにまずは隠す、と言うことを学びました😀

奈良公園は徒歩で散策して回れる範囲に、興福寺、春日大社、東大寺、正倉院となどの名所や大仏像や金剛力士像など国宝級の銅像、木造が目白押し。自然に囲まれた広々とした敷地を鹿と戯れながらめぐる観光は最高です。私たちは紅葉の時期に🍁いったのですが、広大な春日大社の敷地の紅葉は最高でした。思わず花札の鹿の構図を撮ろうと紅葉の下にいる鹿を撮りまくりました☺️",Tripadvisor
Well planned tour and it was a full day including lunch. Deer park should be great for kids and there were so many hungry and greedy deer. Really enjoyed it,Tripadvisor
"Le parc de Nara est très grand et plein d'activités : temples, musées, lacs, espaces naturels et, bien sûr, les daims apprivoisés qui se baladent entre les touristes et se laissent facilement approcher, caresser et nourrir.

タクシーで行ったのですが、車内で運転手さんより、人の少ないシーズンは、鹿がおせんべいをねだってかなり強引になるので気をつけてね、と言われました。その通りで鹿せんべいを買ったところから狙われ（笑）、中にはコートのすそを噛んで引っ張る鹿も。とはいえ楽しく過ごし、広々として緑がいっぱいの公園は、いつ来ても良いところだなと感じます。奈良は大好きですが、中でもこの公園から大仏殿への雄大さは圧倒されます。,Tripadvisor
"I just wanted to thank you for accompanying me on my Fuji journey. From start to finish you chaps are everything one needs to ascend and descend. The recommendation came from Lonely Planet and I could not be more pleased with taking their advice.
I did everything FMG website advised. All the kit and supplies. I needed nothing more and importantly nothing less! The only thing I couldn’t pack since it was delivered throughout the tour, was the advice, companionship, encouragement and humor provided by you chaps. Unfathomable how you managed it, but you always popped up by my side exactly when I needed you. I had so many points when I thought I had no more to give. Not least in the wee small hours 400m below the summit. I still do not know how I summited. Nor how I descended. I had nothing left for so much of the trip, but you and Fujisan helped me tease out just one more switchback, just one more slope, just one more step. I know now, there is so much more to me than I ever imagined. Fuji taught me I have hidden depths, but more than that, respect for myself, for nature, for my fellow Fuji-ers, for you chaps & the mountain folk who keep Fuji open to us.

But above all I learnt humility.

It was the singularly most grueling and brutal physical challenge I have ever undertaken.
Thank you chaps. A life changing event.
And the only piece of advice anyone needs in attempting Fuji is: Go with Mount Fuji Guides.",Tripadvisor
紅葉の時期に夫婦で訪れました。奈良公園内の興福寺の駐車場に。午後５時までの駐車で千円前払いです。午後からは満車になり、空き待ち状態になります。至る所に鹿がいる光景は非日常的。道路を横断する鹿もいるので要注意。向かい側のバスターミナル付近には、ビーフカツ専門のレストランやコンビニもあります。鹿せんべいを売っている露天商のおばちゃんがあちこちに。観光客が鹿せんべいを買っていると、すかさずたくさんの鹿が寄ってきます。袋を開けようものなら、鹿が我先にとおねだり。手にした女性がキャーキャー言いながら逃げまどいます。鹿に追われる姿が見えるのがとても面白かったです。,Tripadvisor
紅葉を見に朝8時半頃に奈良公園に行きました。鹿せんべい売りのおばちゃんがいたので1束200円の鹿せんべいを買いました。お腹が空いている鹿はすでに鹿せんべい売り場近くに集まっており鹿せんべいを買った瞬間から鹿が大量に寄ってきます。時には早くせんべいを渡せと頭でどついてきます。逃げても追っかけてきます。ストールを巻いた女性は鹿からかじられる姿を何度も目撃しました。,Tripadvisor
多くの方が一度は訪れたことがあるかと思います。奈良を代表する観光地です。広さ660ヘクタールとのことですが、あまりに広いので、どこまでが公園内なのか解りません。園内至るところに鹿がいます。鹿は遠く常陸の国、鹿島神宮からやって来たと伝えられ、神様のお使いとして大切にされています。飼われているわけではなく、野生の鹿です。鹿はおとなしい性格ですが、野生の鹿です。身の危険を感じた時は自分の身を守る行動に出ます。いたずらをしたり、虐めたりすると攻撃をされ怪我をすることもあると聞きました。,Tripadvisor
"Extreme weather be prepared. Went with Fuji Guides a week before the season started. They were excellent. When someone got altitude sick one guide went back to lower hut with them. We had 6 guides to 30 people.

奈良公園位在奈良市區東側，包含樹林綠地、寺社古蹟、博物館、池塘、山丘，面積約6.6平方公里，是奈良市區最重要的觀光區。在東大寺參道前、春日大社旁的廣大草地上，有為數眾多的鹿，等著觀光客餵食鹿仙貝，也是奈良最有名氣的觀光活動。不過成年的鹿很大隻，搶食仙貝很積極，偶而會嚇到遊客。可惜少數遊客沒有愛護物動物之心，亂丟零食塑膠袋差點被鹿誤食，或是捉弄小鹿，看了很痛心。,Tripadvisor

There are numerous restaurants and establishments to shop like clothes, branded shoes and many other souvenirs that you can take home.

"nel Parco Imperiale di Kyoto (Kyōto Gyoen) si trovano due importanti strutture; il Palazzo Imperiale di Sento (Sentō Gosho) ed il Palazzo Imperiale di Kyoto (Kyōto Gosho).
il Palazzo Imperiale è la residenza “secondaria” della famiglia imperiale a Kyoto; fino al 1868, prima che la capitale fosse spostata da Kyoto a Tokyo, era la loro principale dimora.
è composto da numerosi edifici in legno che danno vita ad una piccola città in perfetto stile architettonico giapponese.
gli edifici sono chiusi al pubblico per cui non sono visitabili all’interno; alcune stanze vengono aperte per rendere visibili dall’esterno dipinti e parenti.
tutti possono visitare i giardini e le strutture esterne (gli interni rimangono chiusi al pubblico) senza dover prenotare.

"Este Palacio imperial se encuentra al norte del centro de Kioto y vale la pena dedicarle un tiempo para recorrerlo. Tiene unos jardines exteriores al predio amurallado propio del castillo, muy grandes, con una zona de lago y bosquecillo de cerezos blancos que en Marzo /abril es un verdadero sueño !!!!!!!
Luego , se rodea la muralla hasta una de las puertas, ubicada más al norte, y se ingresa al castillo . Se puede recorrer todos los parques y pequeños santuarios y se ve desde fuera las instalaciones principales del Palacio, reservadas al emperador.
Está muy biien conservado, con numerosos tapices de papel, pintados a mano, muy bellos. Los jardines internos son preciosos y la recorrida es sencilla y por una zona delimitada.
Fuera de la muralla, la recorrida es libre, y vale la pena llevarse algo de comer /beber y quedarse un rato allí bajo los cerezos.",Tripadvisor
"I see a lot of high star reviews, so maybe I just have different, taste, but I didn't think the palace was anything special. I went my first day in Kyoto because my hostel was close by. Most of the grounds have been converted to a park, which is a nice walk and no doubt something I would do often if I lived here. The actual palace grounds are free to peruse, which is nice, though you cannot go inside the actual buildings. Overall, while a nice example of traditional japanese architecture, it's very understated and relatively underwhelming for being the palace of the worlds longest reigning monarchy. It makes sense when you consider it was built when the imperial family was just a figurehead, so they didn't have access to the finances for something lavish.

My advice, see it if you have time to kill, but otherwise check out Nijo Castle instead for a much grander picture of medieval japanese architecture and style.",Tripadvisor
Wunderschöner buddhistischer Tempel. So auch die gesamten Anlage. Hier kann man in sich gehen und die Ruhe genießen. Auch die Aussicht ist fantastisch. Mitte März waren weniger Touris wie wir hier. Die Kirschblüte hatte auch schon angefangen. Wunderschön!,Tripadvisor

However, I was very moved by the sights I had never seen before, such as the Kiyomizu stage and the three storied pagoda.

"Avendo due figlie adolescenti ho visitato altri parchi Disney è questo è assolutamente deludente rispetto agli altri.
Prima di tutto, pur avendo scelto per la visita un giorno infrasettimanale nella settimana successiva alle vacanze giapponesi, abbiamo trovato una folla inverosimile.
Siamo entrati verso le 9.30 e le code per le attrazioni principali superavano le due ore. Alle 9.45 per la novità “Soaring: fantastic flight” c’era un’attesa di 230 minuti! Improponibile! E i fast pass erano già terminati. Siamo riusciti a prendere il fast pass per un paio di attrazioni e abbiamo fatto un’ora di coda per altre due. Tutto qui.
Inoltre, rispetto ad altri parchi Disney, ho trovato poca atmosfera. Nè parate, né spettacoli... complice la pioggia? Oltretutto ha diluviato tutto il giorno ma questo non è bastato a far diminuire i tempi di attesa.
Lo sconsiglio, è una giornata buttata via",Tripadvisor
"Premesso che negli anni abbiamo visto quelli di Orlando, Parigi, Los Angeles e Shanghai, questo è in assoluto il più bello e curato di tutti.

Anche le attrazioni con nomi simili a quelle che si trovano in altri parchi (come Indiana Jones) sono completamente diverse e sorprendenti.

- Viaggio al centro della terra
- Indiana Jones
- Spettacoli (tutti)
- Toy Story

Abbiamo visitato il parco durante il nostro viaggio in Giappone e non posso che consigliarlo ai fan del topo più simpatico del mondo. Lo spettacolo serale sulla baia intorno alla quale si sviluppano le varie zone del parco vale il prezzo del biglietto.

"Bellissimo, adatto ad un ragazzino di 12 anni ma tutta la famiglia si è divertita. Le attrazioni più belle sono: 20.000 sotto i mari, Viaggio al centro della terra, Indiana Jones e, per rilassarsi, Sinbad. Il fast pass è comodo ma siccome fra uno e l'altro devono trascorrere 2 ore, si riesce a prenderne al massimo 3. Alternativa comoda è l'ingresso singolo. Andateci!",Tripadvisor
"Questo è sicuramente il parco divertimenti più bello che abbia mai visto in vita mia (e ne ho visti tanti!) Non si tratta del classico parco disney, non ci sono aree dedicate a fiabe. Il parco contiene attrazioni imponenti e uniche, non presenti negli altri disneyland, scenografie spettacolari, aree tematiche bellissime. Per chi visita Tokyo a mio avviso è quasi un’obbligo andarci. Il biglietto non è molto costoso 50€ circa. Se avete solo un giorno a disposizione vi consiglio di visitare il DisneySea anzichè il parco disneyland, in quanto è unico al mondo, c’è solo a Tokyo, mentre i disneyland ci sono anche a Parigi e in America e sono simili. Il parco DisneySea è raggiungibile da Tokyo con la metro, si scende a maihama e si prende la monorotaia (a pagamento, costa 1,70€ a tratta). Il parco è sempre molto affollato.. ci vuole tanta pazienza. Le attrazioni principali “viaggio al centro della terra”, “indiana Jones”, o “tower of terror” sono tra le più richieste, e ci sono minimo code da un’ora. Bisogna mettersela via e farsele. Altrimenti potete usare i fast pass ma terminano già il mattino e vincolano gli orari dell’accesso. Tenete conto che code da un’ora o un’ora e mezza le farete solo per le attrazioni principali, le altre sono circa 10/20 minuti. In ogni caso, consiglio assolutamente la visita, ne vale proprio la pena.",Tripadvisor
Vale sempre la pena in qualsiasi parte del mondo ti trovi di visitare un parco Disney ... come a Parigi ... così anche qui ho provato delle emozioni uniche ... la cosa più bella è che il parco Disney Sea a Tokyo è unico per struttura e attrazioni non presenti in alcun altro parco Disney nel mondo !! Lo consiglio vivamente a tutti ... più il parco Disney Sea che il Disneyland di Tokyo in quanto il primo è esclusivo di Tokyo in tutto il mondo !!,Tripadvisor

"Giornata con bambini di 9, 11 e 13 anni a Disney Sea a fine agosto. Questo parco mi è sembrato più adatto alla loro età rispetto al Disney Resort. L'ingresso é alle 8.00 ma la fila comincia prima delle 7. Chi non ha il biglietto deve fare due file: una per l'acquisto del biglietto e poi l'altra per l'ingresso. La biglietteria apre alle 7.30. I fast pass sono gratuiti e vengono rilasciati da apposite macchinette vicino le singole attrazioni fino alle 15 circa. Senza fast pass file per oltre un'ora. Consiglio subito una corsa per il primo fast pass al momento dell'ingresso.  Giornata complessivamente divertente ma, ovviamente, molto stancante. Cibo per tutti i gusti e per tutte le tasche. Molto ordinato, come tutto d'altronde in Giappone.",Tripadvisor
"仙洞御所と京都迎賓館へ行った後へ行きました。
すでに相当な距離を、京都御苑内で歩いていたうえ、入り口がまさか側面にあるとは思わず、仙洞御所から京都御所を一周してしまいました。

間違えた道から行くと、御所の角に猿が辻？！というところがあったようで、修学旅行生が撮影していたので、見学していきました。
本当に猿が檻にはいっているような状態の細工があり楽しめました。

御所自体は、すでに立派なものを見た後だったからか、疲れていたからなのか、感動は一切なくて、ただ、だだっぴろい場所を歩いたというだけの感想です。
そもそも、今は全く使われることのない施設で、観光のためだけに整備されているそうなので、余計に何も感じないのだと思います。

あちらこちらや、ひな人形でも見られる、左近の桜、右近の橘があり、これが本物かと、若干心が動きました。

あとは、源氏物語の世界を、相当イマジネーションを働かせて想像してみないと、よくわからない、だだっぴろい場所という感想です。",Tripadvisor

The experience is fine. It's a slightly uphill road walk then some stairs. There are a multitude of temples that can be visited for free. As well there is a beautiful view point without paying entrance fees. The entrance fee is 400¥ and it is cash only. The nearest ATM is back at the bottom of the hill.,Tripadvisor
中学の修学旅行で来ているのかもしれないのですが、京都市内と大阪がセットの観光で訪問場所の印象が薄く、初めて来たつもりで歩きました。警察の警備の対象で入口で荷物のチェックを受けて番号札着用で歩きました。軽く30分以上は歩いたと思います。あちこちに立っているスタッフはあまり御所の建物をことを詳しく知らないようであくまで警備要員のようですが、これもどうかと思いました。基本的に建物の中には入らないで外から見て歩くので、雨が降っていないときに行くのがベストな場所です。,Tripadvisor

"Vi valgte ett hotell litt nærme parken for vi tenkte at denne parken lom til å gi oss masse fine opplevelser. Men når vi kommer inni parken og strener mot palasset, så møter vi store åpne ubrukte veier, som det innimellom kommer biler og slitne mennesker på. Vi finner få steder å sette seg ned for å kose seg eller observere livet i parken, og liv i parken var det veldig lite av. Palasset ligger praktfullt i midten, men innbyder ikke til å ta turen innom med parken som ligger rundt. Vi har sett mange fine parker og bygninger i Tokyo til nå, denne er ikke på toppen.",Tripadvisor

"Istana ini pernah digunakan sebagai pusat pemerintahan dan tempat tinggal Kekaisaran th 1868 sebelum di pindah ke Tokyo/Edo.

Inilah yg menjadi alasan mengapa saya sangat antusias untuk mengunjungi tempat ini. Disamping penuh dengan sejarah, bangunan yang indah,taman kota yg luas dan taman di dalam istana yg sangat menarik perhatian.

Seperti Taman Oikeniwa ,taman dengan pepohonan rindang dengan kolam. Tamannya bagus sekali dan sangat terawat .

Di dalam kompleks istana yang memiliki luas hampir 27 hektar ini, terdapat bangunan yg mempunyai fungsi yg berbeda - beda.Shodaibuma utk tempat pertemuan resmi, Seiryoden sbg tempat tinggal Kaisar, dan dari beberapa tempat yang paling penting adalah Shishinden .bangunan utk upacara resmi seperti upacara penobatan Kaisar.

Apabila ingin mengetahui lebih detail tentang sejarah Kyoto Imperial Palace bisa mengikuti tour keliling istana dgn pemandu secara gratis tapi harus mendaftar terlevih dahulu ke Imperial Agency Office atau secara online.

Sayang sekali pengunjung tidak diperbolehkan memasuki bagian dalam istana, hanya bagian luar istana saja.",Tripadvisor
"E’ uno dei templi buddhisti più belli ed emozionanti di tutto il Giappone.
E’ situato a est di Kyoto e sorge sulle acque della cascata Otowa da cui prende il nome. Infatti Kiyomizu-dera significa letteralmente “Tempio dell’acqua pura”.
Il tempio è uno dei più visitati del Giappone, soprattutto in primavera ed in autunno, grazie al suo meraviglio panorama cosparso di fiori di ciliegio e alberi di acero. In questo periodo vi è anche una bellissima illuminazione serale che rende l’atmosfera straordinaria.
La terrazza e la struttura principale del tempio sono state costruite in legno e senza l’utilizzo di neanche un chiodo. La terrazza è molto scenica ed è uno dei punti che più saltano all’occhio dei turisti in quanto si appoggia su una grande struttura di travi in legno, alte circa 13 metri che poggiano sulla collina sottostante. La visuale di Kyoto che si ha dalla terrazza è formidabile ed è uno dei punti da non perdersi assolutamente, anche in presenza di tantissime persone!
La sala principale, ampissima, è dedicata alla dea della compassione Kannon.
Subito dietro la sala principale sorge il santuario di Jishu, dedicato alla dea dell’amore.
Alla base del tempio principale si trova la foce della cascata Otowa.

"This is our review for Mt Fuji Sightseeing Private Day tour operated by Japan Graviton Tours through “Get Your Guide” app which was recommended by a friend of us. The app is amazing and flawless however to know more about Japan Graviton Tours please carry on reading. I’m posting it here for awareness.
While looking at different options, we decided on the current one due to having two itineraries to choose from on the day and the good reviews.
Paid the premium fee and got a confirmation saying to be ready at 8 am for a 10 hour day trip.
Woke up early and while waiting in the hotel lobby we received a text message from the driver stating that he will pick us up at 9 am. Still excited for the day trip we left the hotel around 9:30 and informed the driver Mr Ali that we would like to do itinerary A, Picture attached.
It took us around 3 hours drive to reach our first stop, Mt. Fuji to discover that the Japanese authorities have changed the rules, and no private cars can reach station No.5. As a tour operator they were not aware of such change and the first initial reaction from our driver was we cannot go up, let’s move on to the next stop on the itinerary. I insisted to further ask around as the main attraction of this day tour is the famous mountain Mt. Fuji. We found out that the only way to get up there is by bus. We ended up paying return tickets for 4 people 8750 Yen whereas on the itinerary it says the price to pay is 2100 Yen for a group, Picture attached. These kinds of Extras were not planned for. It took us around 3 hours visiting Mt Fuji due the unforeseen circumstances.
The next one on the list was Oishi Park but we ended up shuffling the attractions sights based on the driver’s instructions that this one is close by, etc... What we have noticed that Mr Ali is not a tour guide, he is just a driver replacing his friend who wasn’t able to join. He is a lovely person however not cut to be a tour guide.
Another issue we encountered that the 8 attractions sites are not doable within a 10 hour frame. When we asked the driver, he said that the tour organiser offers these different sites however the clients would have to decide which one’s they would like to visit. My argument is, why put them under an itinerary when it’s impossible to do. The same applies to itinerary B if chosen.
Faced with theses issues we ended up doing 1,2,4 and 5 out of 8 touristic sites, see attached pictures. The main reason is time, every place requires an hour or two to visit and others may take longer however never got the chance to discover.
As a conclusion, for this premium price tag we were disappointed of the quality of service and professionalism. We were misled by the impressive itineraries which are impossible to achieve in a day tour.
What was shocking was upon arrival to our hotel, the driver apologised for the inconvenience caused and had the decency to asks us to write a good review. What seems to matter to them is the review and the number of stars rather than honesty. Please be aware.",Tripadvisor

"We would not have come, and spent yen4000 on taxis of we had realised it was free to enter. If you have a lot of time in Kyoto, maybe worth a visit. In winter the surrounding gardens do not offer much to see. A 15 minut walk to the Castle which is more worthwhile.",Tripadvisor

京都御所のＨＰから見学を９：３０（日本語）と設定し今出川駅から歩き、入場門：清所門から入場。休憩所でお土産やトイレを済ませ待機。何気に集合して注意事項を聞きながら見学開始。説明を聞きながら回るので写真を撮ったり、確認したりで忙しい。一巡すると戻って写真を撮れません。ですからこれぞと思う個所は自撮りを含め撮って下さい、我々はもう一度回りました。結構面白い施設などを見て回りました。,Tripadvisor

"The official seat of Emperor till Meiji era begun, there is a lot of historic value associated with this palace. Entrance is free, and you get a ID card when entering. You get to walk past the palatial buildings where the kings resided, although no entry is allowed into any of these and one must take solace in appreciating and photographing them from outside.

As you walk through palaces, you enter into a Japanese garden- one of the more beautiful ones in Kyoto where the early autumn colors made it stand out. Overall not a mind-boggling attraction, but given it’s free price and immense historic value as Emperor’s residence for ~1100 years (renovated multiple times), I’d say the place is worth a visit if you have time.",Tripadvisor
It is a place where you can feel and understand a little bit about the culture and traditions remained up to theses days in Japan. So interesting to walk inside the palace and imagine how many things had happened inside those walls.... I enjoyed a lot!,Tripadvisor
"御所は周囲に高い築地塀をめぐらしています。外も中も広大でした。参観者は”清所門”というところから入ります。手荷物検査があります。見学は1日4回。宮内庁職員さんのガイドのもと見学ができます。私たちは朝9時半のガイドに間に合うように行きました。
あいにくの雨でしたが、それがかえって荘厳な雰囲気になったように思います。
参観者休所でちょっとしたお土産なども売られていました。

"Mount Fuji is one of the iconic sites in Japan and she really behaved herself for us. For the 2 days we were there she had no cloud cover so we got some amazing photos of her snow covered peak, especially as it was cherry blossom time.

Definitely a bucket list place to visit.",Tripadvisor

"Must-do when you go to Japan. If you want to see Mount Fuji with snow go there before end of May, afterwards the snow is gone. For a little hike I recommend going to 5th station and do the round Fuji trail (about 1 hour).",Tripadvisor
"It was quite a long and twisty road up to the view point at the 5th station and there were many strapping lads cycling up the over 2Km in elevation (practicing for the Tour de France I presume), which I would have done if we passed a bicycle rental shop. It wasn’t clear of clouds at the top but luckily there were occasional breaks that afforded us a view of the peak. There were lots of tourist shops, cafes and car parks.",Tripadvisor
"Mount Fiji is a perfect place to take in Japan's traditional religion and culture; Mount Fuji is Japan's highest mountain. Mount Fuji is 60 miles (100 km) from Japan's capital, Tokyo.

京都御所は、初見参、皇居と共に、小生は、あまり興味が涌かないが、宿泊した渓山閣の営業の方が、ガイドをわざわざ出向いてしてくれ、何の予備知識のない農協の組合員に説明してくれたことは、頭が下ります。京都御所を短時間で理解させてくれたことは有難い事です。歴史のある建物の見学には、有料でもガイドが必要です。京都御苑は、いなく１時間くらい散策したが、中国人の観光客も、新型肺炎の影響で、ほとんどいなく、人気スポットであり本来なら、観光客でごった返しているそうですが、ゆっくり見学できました。桜の咲く季節の見学がいいと思います。,Tripadvisor

"The title ""Imperial Palace"" gives the impression that this will be quite grand and perhaps once upon a time it was but I have to say there was little to see. The video in the information centre was interesting but the buidlings themselves were less so.

There is free WIFI so you can get your bearings and plan your next stop.",Tripadvisor
"We had originally only put aside 1.5 hours for this but in the end spent 2 hours.

The grounds are well laid out but on gravel so travelling with a pushchair could prove difficult although there is a route for disabled.

There is an information centre which gives information on the trees and the park through the seasons.

It is free to go to the palace which is really well set out with a walking route. You are able to walk at your own pace and there are lots of information plaques around giving the history and purpose of each building.

The tour ends with the palace gardens.

The surrounding park is littered with shrine sites which you are free to enter.

We went at 10.30 in the morning and it was not at all busy. If you want a tour of the Sento Imperial Palace you will need to book ahead.

Plenty of clean European toilets.",Tripadvisor

誰もが知っている京都の有名寺院です。過去に何度も来ているのですが、懸造の本堂や奥の院から一望できる京都の景色、紅葉の見事さなど、ついつい足を運んでしまう魅力があります。枕草子にもさわがしきものとして清水寺の縁日の賑わいが書かれていますから、日本人のDNAとして好きなんじゃないかな、と思っています。朝早くから参拝できるのも良いところで、早朝に訪れれば静かに境内の散策や紅葉の鑑賞ができます。高台寺方面から一念坂、二年坂と上り、途中で八坂の塔へ寄り道してから産寧坂を上って清水寺へ行くのは京都観光の王道で、京都に行き慣れた方は選ばないルートかも知れませんが、王道だけに絶対に外れないルートでもあります。是非どうぞ。,Tripadvisor

"This is my second time visit Kyoto Imperial Palace. My point of interest is the magnificent building and the history it self.This time I took a tour around the Palace with an English guide to find out in detail the history of the Kyoto Imperial Palace.

We had to reserve in advance by filling out the form and showing passport at The Imperial Household Agency Office.

Tour is about 1 hour. Visitors not allowed to enter inside of the palace. This tour is worth since we will get info and explaination in detail the history and function of building within the Kyoto Imperial Palace and the park as well. We are free to ask, the guide will patiently answer all questions from visitors.

"If you have time then it is fine to go since it is for free and you do not have access to the interior of the palace anyway.
There was some constructions works going on, and the tour is not interesting, also the emperror's throne was not there since they moved it to Tokyo for the celebration.
I would recommend to go to Nijo castle, you have to pay for that one but totally worth it.

"Il palazzo si estende su una superficie molto grande ed è composto da diverse aree.
Consigliato avere una guida che vi porti a vedere i punti di maggiore interesse dandovi anche un'infarinatura sulla storia degli edifici.

"現在ある建物は1855年の造営なのだそうです。中国の故宮の敷地は72万㎡、韓国の景福宮の敷地は34万㎡で。京都御所は11万㎡です。やはり、戦国時代から江戸時代までの天皇は実質的な権力者ではなかったので、そのお住まいも小さかったのでしょうか。小さいと言っても、結構な広さです。建物は木目の茶色と漆喰の白のコントラストで、その静謐さが日本らしいです。残念なのが、建物内に入れないこと。外観を見るだけでは、どのような設えなのかが全く分かりません。せめて戸を開けて、外から内部を見られたらいいのですが･･･
昭和天皇の即位の礼はここ京都御所で行われ、紫宸殿で平成･令和の｢即位の礼・正殿の儀｣と同じ儀式が行われたそうです。そう考えれば、まだ古の歴史建造物という位置づけにするには早く、内部公開をするにはまだまだ時間がかかるのでしょう。",Tripadvisor

一日歩き回りかなり疲れていたのですが、気力を振り絞り訪問しました。堺町御門から御苑敷地内に入り、広い砂利道を歩けど歩けどなかなかたどり着かず、ようやく御所前へ。ヘロヘロになっていたところ巡回のパトカーがやってきて、シャキッとしないと怪しい人に見られそうでまた歩き…　あたりは段々暗くなってきて腰も痛くなってきて、はあもう帰ろうと振り向いた瞬間、薄暗い空に天に昇る一筋の雲が。なんの霊感も信仰もない私ですが、あまりにも神々しく感じられ、思わず見入ってしまいました。とても美しい光景でした。,Tripadvisor
"Aside from how visually arresting the main structure is, i was surprised at how beautiful and calming the whole area is. Recommend visiting early in the morning, with less people you can really soak up the calming feeling all around the temple plus enjoy walking in the surrounding park areas. As it’s an active temple, you will likely to be lucky to catch some of the mornings chants in practice too.",Tripadvisor

■紫宸殿（ししんでん）
元弘元年（元徳3年、1331年）、後醍醐天皇が京都を脱出した後に、鎌倉幕府が擁立した光厳天皇がこれを里内裏として以降、明治天皇の東京奠都に至るまで約550年間にわたって使用され続けた内裏である。

■建礼門
紫宸殿（天皇の即位、元服、立太子、節会など、最重要の公的儀式が執り行われた建物）の正中の門。ここから紫宸殿の神々にご挨拶しました。 

■白雲神社
主祭神　妙音弁財天。
旧西園寺家の鎮守社であり、1224年（元仁元年）に西園寺公経が北山殿造営に際し建立した妙音堂に由来するとされています。
1769年（明和6年）、西園寺邸とともに御苑内に移りました。明治以降、西園寺家が東京に移り「白雲神社」と称されるようになりました。

■宗像神社
宗像三女神（多紀理比売命、多岐都比売命、市寸島比売命を主祭神に、倉稲魂神と天岩戸開神の2柱を配祀する。 
明治天皇の東京奠（てん）都によって御苑内へ鎮座とされました。

■厳島神社
主祭神　市杵島姫命、田心姫命、湍津姫命の宗像三女神。
配祀　祇園女御（平清盛公の母またはその姉（清盛公の伯母）との説があります）。
九条家の邸宅で鎮守社として祀られていましたが、九条家が東京へ移築され、当社はそのまま残されました。",Tripadvisor
"The imperial palace offers a free guided tour of the gardens. However you can see all the same things on your own. The tour does not take you to any off-limits or hidden spots. You are not allowed inside any of the palace buildings. You simply get a bit more history and explanation of the buildings if you do the tour. It is offered in English at 10am.

The rest of the park outside the actual palace gardens is peaceful and not crowded. If you are planning to be in this area, I do recommend making a reservation for a guided tour of the State Guest House which is also located within the park. This is where foreign dignitaries stay when visiting Kyoto. It was quite fascinating.",Tripadvisor

"Taman ini bersambungan dengan kuil Todaiji, jadi setelah melihat kuil Todaiji dan makan siang kami melanjutkan mengeksplor taman Nara (Nara park).
Taman ini sangat indah di musim gugur dengan daun daun beraneka warna. Di taman ini juga berliaran rusa-rusa. Rusa di kota Nara memang dibiarkan berkeliaran, karena rusa dianggap binatang sakral dan rusa dijadikan maskot kota Nara. Kita bisa memberi makan rusa-rusa dengan makanan rusa yang kita beli dari pedagang pedagang di pinggir jalan. It's so fun!
Recommended untuk dikunjungi bila ke kota Nara.

"If you are tolerant of crowds, this is a very pretty setting, with numerous shrines to visit. Waterfront walk is scenic, however just behind it is a maze of commercialization, cheap souvenirs, and tourists.

I’m sure once it’s done it will be dramatic.",Tripadvisor

嵐山は今、桜が満開（４月４日）で訪れるのには最高の時です。例年、今頃は内外の観光客で大混雑します。ところが今年は、新型コロナウイルスの関係で人出は極端に少ないです。特に外国人観光客と国内団体観光客は全く見かけません。この日も観光バスは１台も見なかったです。また、渡月橋から野宮神社までの竹林の歩道も、ほとんど人は歩いていません。観光用人力車も乗る客がなく、車を引くお兄さんも手持無沙汰の様子でした。テイクアウトの店や土産物店もガラガラで、さみしい限りです。その分、ゆったり散策できますが，この状況が続けば京都の観光産業がどれだけ打撃を受けるのか、心配です。,Tripadvisor

"Raggiungibile con pochi minuti di treno da Kyoto questo è un posto da non perdere. Forse meno grande di come lo si immagini, e in alcune ore del giorno anche molto affollato ma camminare in mezzo a questi bamboo altissimi è veramente un qualcosa di suggestivo. Molto belli anche i templi annessi al percorso che però non ho avuto modo di visitare.",Tripadvisor
"When I first entered the bamboo garden, I felt very underwhelmed. There were few bamboos on either side, and then it got over. However thankfully we kept walking and we were greeted by huge bamboo on both sides for quite a distance. We went around 5 pm, it was getting slightly dark and was the perfect time of the day. You won’t be walking inside a bamboo forest though, just will have huge bamboo on both sides and the central road is paved for walking. No vehicles are allowed, so it makes for a nice stroll despite quantity of tourists. It is worth the hype, and we’re glad we did it resulting in very picturesque photos.",Tripadvisor

"We had booked a morning visit to Saihō-ji, a zen temple famous for its moss-covered gardens, and having arrived rather early so we could take a walk around the mountain setting, we discovered what is the southernmost end of the Arashiyama park. Most people enter at the Monkey Park or Tenryu-ji, and from a distance on the highway you can see the throngs of people lining up for a visit to either.

We ourselves had planned to also enter from there on the following day, but we count ourselves very fortunate to find that Arashima Mountain had the southern entry point. The area of the entrance is residential, and we just followed a few early morning elderly hikers along the mountain path. We didn't realize where we were until we saw a map of the mountain paths.

The serenity of the area, lack of tourists, the beauty of both the bamboo and other trees enclosing us, all of this put us into the perfect mindset for our later visit to Saiho-ji. We spent about an hour and half just wandering around the mountain paths, only encountering a handful of people. No crowds, no annoying self-proclaimed ""influencers"" taking selfies or filming video -- just natural beauty and peace.

If you planned for a full morning or afternoon, you could eventually walk the 4+ kilometers to the northern exit and eventually meet up with the tourist crowds. but that kind of defeats the purpose of such an excursion in our opinion.

At the entrance gate there was a sign warning to watch out for bears. We didn't see any. It was just us, the trees, the bamboo, and the sounds of birds and flowing water from the various streams.",Tripadvisor

"Like most of Kyoto’s “instagram” spots, it is absolutely overrun with crowds of people.

The view is striking, but if you hate crowds you’re not missing much. It is free though, so worth visiting if you’re on a budget.

Much smaller than you think. Only takes 2 months for the bamboo to grow that big. I recommend you take the bike Kyoto early bird Arashiyama bike tour.,Tripadvisor
"It's a sight to behold with all the tall bamboos reaching for the skies. Although since we arrived a bit late in the morning the place was teeming with tourists and so many tour groups. My husband likes to take it slow so we are not early starters.
Let's start with the commute. We got to the Arashiyama station no problem and just followed the crowd but we made the mistake of heading towards the bridge by turning left on the Arashiyama shopping street so instead Once you reach the Arashiyama shopping street, look for a small sign that says Bamboo Grove and follow the arrow. That road leading to the bamboo grove is right next to Snoopy Chocolate store and I'll add a picture of it.
The walk is quite short maybe like 10-15 minutes but we stopped to take lots of pictures and had to wade through the other tourists and wait for a decent picture perfect shot with no one around which is almost impossible actually so go early if you can.
It was a superb day but it did drizzle a bit even when the weather forecast said no rain so always bring a rain jacket or umbrella.
We walked along the Tugetsukyo Bridge and it's a nice walk but again many tourists. If you walk away from the shopping street, this is the way to the Monkey Park which we chose not to go
walked along the Shopping Street. Glad we had an early lunch because restaurants here are pretty expensive not surprising.
Lots of trinkets souvenirs snacks and restaurants. We also walked along side streets since they were so pretty. 6iu can spend the whole day here.",Tripadvisor
"Arashiyama Bamboo Forest is a must-visit attraction for us as we have heard so much about this world-famous site.

Because we were based in Osaka, we bought the Hankyu 1 Day Tourist Pass to experience the trains along Hankyu Lines.

From Arashiyama Station it was a pleasant short walk to Tenryu-ji Temple. We visited the Zen garden of the temple and walked to the back of the garden. From there, we exited the garden and entered the bamboo forest.

We enjoyed the short walk along the path through the bamboo forest. Because we reached the place at 10:30am it was a little crowded. But it was orderly so it was not a major issue except that we could not take photographs without capturing other tourists. So it is important to head out early to avoid the crowd.

The forest was very well maintained and the air was fresh. So it made for a very pleasant stroll.",Tripadvisor
"Early in the morning is key, to catch a memorable photo of this exquisite setting. So tranquil and spiritual until the hoards of people arrive and then, it would be a challenge. We also enjoyed Arashiyama town. It was a cute but vibrant setting. It was autumn when we went there, so the beautiful deep red and golden leaves set the scene. We would have loved to have spent more time there. Arigato gozaimusu from New Zealand",Tripadvisor
We drove here and luckily found a parking spot on the street near Arasiyama even though parking is very scarce. It’s a short 5 min walk from the Arasiyama train station - no entrance fee.

"Travelling with a mate? Don’t take your eyes off them when the chaos begins!

Very cool to experience such planned mayhem!

I couldn’t believe the sheer number of people that flocked every few minutes to cross. It felt like the masses surrounding us were a payed flash mob employed to just create the phenomenon that is the “shibuya crossing”

Free Vantage points are generally packed out so prepare to wait a few minutes to find that perfect vantage point to capture the movement!",Tripadvisor
"If you come to Tokyo, its a must that you come to see and feel that you are the part of the most crowded crossing in the world. The amazing things that all peoples that crossing the road the same time always care to each other so it always safe from pushing or fall during it. You can simply go to shibuya station and out from Hatchiko exit where you can take pic with the famous Hatchiko statue and just infront if it is shibuya crossing. If you wanna take a good look of it, you can simply go to starbuck which located at the second floor of one of the building beside shibuya crossing",Tripadvisor

Emblematico della popolazione di Tokyo è questo incrocio considerato il più trafficato al mondo. A testimonianza del passaggio delle persone le strisce pedonali hanno una dimensione di 30 metri di larghezza in tutti i sensi e sono anche in diagonale. Quando scatta il segnale di via libera una fiumana ininterrotta di persone ti circonda avvolgendoti nel suo flusso e rendendo problematico lo scegliere una direzione.,Tripadvisor
"We saw the crossing when it wasn't at it's busiest peak and it was still very busy! One of those things that is important to ""check off the list"" when in Tokyo. Lots of great restaurants nearby. We asked a gal who was in a ""visitor center"" trailer near the statue of Hachi for a recommendation of where to get Ramen and she gave us a local place that was in the building next to the Shibuya crossing building.",Tripadvisor
"Yes, it is a one of kind street crossing and a Tokyo must see, but the real fun is walking around Shibuya. Near by are very cool stores such as Loft, Tokyo Hands, and the Mega Don Quixote.

"Shibuya Crossing will always be one of the iconic landmarks of Japan; so I made sure that it would be one of my first stops during my first visit to this country.

Stepping out of the station, I was completely overwhelmed by the crowd. Everyone was moving in an orderly fashion and crossing at the designated pedestrian lanes; yet, I was blinded by the bright lights of the LED billboards and by the sheer volume of bodies in the area. We couldn't even find Hachiko's Statue!

It was a surreal experience moving along with the hundreds of bodies crossing the wide streets; but it was definitely an overwhelming one. It's one that I wouldn't like to repeat anymore though! It was simply too crazy for me.",Tripadvisor

"The crossing is very busy and locals queue up in just the right spot. Some tourists seem to like to stop for selfish and find disrupt the flow a little.

Nonetheless, it is an interesting place to visit, even if it is only to use a crossing , ok several crossings and several times, without the need to stop and disrupt anyone.",Tripadvisor
"Finalmente arriviamo alla stazione di Shibuya dopo aver visitato la città tra templi shinto parchi e quartieri moderni ma soprattutto aver vissuto da veri viaggiatori pendolari grazie a JR ticket, abbonamento caro ma comprensivo di tutta la rete ferroviaria bus esclusi. Compresi i velocissimi shinkansen treni proiettili che sono davvero un esempio di velocità puntualità tecnologia. Ma tornando alla famosa piazza-che ricorda Time Square in tono minore perché più schiacciata e prevedibile, tra grattacieli neon insegne e tabelloni multicolori che sembrano aggredire i pochi spazi liberi dai continui attraversamenti pedonali sempre pieni di folla. Certo la famosa statua del fedele cane Akita, in bronzo, circondata da alberi, quasi nascosta dal fitto movimento dei passanti, fa tenerezza. Per una sosta piacevole, scelta una stradina pedonale carica di souvenir, abbiamo scovato un vero pub irlandese con ottima birra e cocktail.",Tripadvisor

"We have visited Arashimaya before in summer and sakura season for the past 3 years. This time we return for the autumn view and we are not disappointed. We took a morning bus number 12 from bus stop in front of Takashimaya building at shimoyoku street. It is a 60 minute journey and cost only 230 yen per person. The bus drop us right 15 meters from the famous Arishiyama bridge. We walk straight to the tenkokuji buddhist temple and enjoy the beautiful autumn leafs. We decided not to visit the bamboo forest because we already did 2 times. This time, we spent more time strolling in the side of Arashiyama river because the autumn view is gorgeous, mesmerizing and tranquil. We will return again maybe next year for the winter.",Tripadvisor

There are also many rickshaw pullers to bring you around if you don't want to walk.

There are also kimono shops so you could get dressed up in one. I had previously made reservations at other kimono shops otherwise I would definitely choose to do it here as it was relatively less crowded than the busy Kyoto or Gion areas. Plus there are so many shops to see, I really wished we could have more time there!",Tripadvisor

Prima di arrivare al bosco c'è un tempio e un giardino che sia in autunno che in in primavera sono uno spettacolo. Anche oltre il Bosco di Bambù sulla destra cè un giardino particolarmente bello.

"Arashiyama is an outskirt district off Kyoto worth a visit due to may reasons. First of, it is located on the bank of Oi/Katsura river with mountain as a backdrop; which will be colorful in fall when all the trees turn red and orange in late November to early December. You can enjoy a short boat ride or even streaming down the river from kameoka, another tourist spot at the end of ""Torokko Scienic train"", down the river to Togetsu Kyu bridge in the center of Arashimaya. Secondly, the Torokko Scenic train mentioned earlier, which run 25 minutes through the valley of fall folliage tree amidst the mountains surrounding the Northwest of Arashiyama is very famous spot for cherry blossom in Spring, colors of falls in autumn, and even the serene white snow in the winter. It is a must for everyone who visit Arashiyama. Thirdly the famous Bamboo forest where you would experience the beauty of thousands of thousands bamboo along both side of a walk through the entire pathway. Next, you would have a chance to visit Ten-ryuji temple, one of UNESCO World Heritage site there is a Word heritage as part of the historic monument of ancient Kyoto. The temple’s highlight includes the magnificent garden “Sogenchi Teien”, offering amazing landscape with the central pond, pine trees and the forest of Arashiyama mountains. Lastly, the sumptuous Kyoto Keizeki here is tempting among other famous local dish such as menu create from Tofu of various cooking method. Lots and I meant ""Lots Lots and lots"" of preserve vegetables (Japanese have it with rice as a main and final court in menu set meal) are offer to try but some of them need keeping in the fridge...",Tripadvisor

It did feel like Tokyo eki, but take a deep breath and get over it to enjoy the Crouching Tiger feeling. To get away from the crowds, we walked to the other side of the river which was restful.",Tripadvisor

Beautiful scenic river and gardens with many interesting things to do: climbing up to see the monkeys, the temples and gardens, the bamboo Grove, the rickshaw tours and river cruises.

"We took the cab from our hotel near the Karasuma station and it cost around ¥3000. We decided to cab it because we wanted to get there before sunrise and beat the crowds. Other than a handful of photographers, the place was still empty and was pitch dark so it really felt peaceful to be surrounded by the bamboo trees. After taking some photos we walked towards the Togetsukyo Bridge, and the view was just amazing. Fall foliage was in fall bloom and everywhere you look was covered in bright yellow, orange and red leaves. There is no fee to this attraction and there’s lots to do around the Arashiyama area so it’s totally worth the visit.",Tripadvisor

"Este barrio está al Oeste de Kioto y se llega bastante fácil desde el centro en Bus 11 o Linea Sagano del tren local JR llega hasta la entrada.
Arashiyama es conocida por su bosque de Bambú pero es mucho más que eso y hay que dedicarle el día entero.
Es un conjunto de colinas o montañas con templitos, miradoes, jardines, bosques, que rodean al río Hozugawa. La zona toma su nombre de la Montaña (yama) Arashi. Es ideal para pasar un hanami entre locales, ya que lo eligen muchísimos lugareños y se puede apreciar la cultura local además de maravillosos paisajes.
En general el turista se decepciona porque sólo visita el pueblio con el pequeño bosque de bambú. Pero adentrense en los caminos y montañas con pequeños y solitarios templos, recorran la márgen del río, mojense los pies entre las rocas y esperen a ver pasar los barquitos tradicionales auténticos, almuercen bajo los cerezos , y despés me cuentan !!!! amaran Arashiyama !!!!!",Tripadvisor

"After seeing numerous pictures on the internet, I had to make a trip to the Arashiyama bamboo forest during my first trip to Kyoto. While beautiful, it was extremely packed with tourists (and nearly impossible to get a “clean” shot).

After walking to the end of the forest, I actually turned to my travel companions and asked “that’s it?”.

Coming here during the day when crowded it’s more of a photo opportunity. But perhaps next time I’ll come early in the morning when there are fewer people and can appreciate the serenity more.

Please do allocate some time to walk around the town of Arashiyama as it’s beautiful with shops and restaurants. Just go early!",Tripadvisor
"We've been twice- once during spring and once during the autumn colours time. The tree colours were amazing and well worth seeing in addition to the sights of the river temple and gardens, but it was very busy. If you want it quieter, but still impressive go in the spring (outside cherry blossom time). We went just as the blossoms were coming out so had it quite quiet and some blooms.",Tripadvisor

It’s amazing how this big number of people cross with ease from four directions at the same time. Stop in the middle of the road and take a selfie you have enough time until the light turns red. There are many terrace that overlook the crossing. Go and watch the view from there.
The area around of the crossing is so vibrant, plenty of stores, coffee shops, and restaurants.
You can easily spend three hours in the area without noticing.
Best time to visit is at sunset. You will experience it in the daylight and enjoy the neon evening lights",Tripadvisor

Un luogo con un'energia incredibile 😦 ogni giorno milioni di persone attraversano anche in diagonale l'incrocio di Shibuya. A mio avviso la vista migliore dall'alto (gratuita) si ottiene dal 17esimo piano dello Sky View del Scramble Building in Shibuja Scrumble square.

"If you plan to head out to Shibuya Crossing (Scramble), try to head out early as you can see how the pedestrian traffic just builds within half an hour. What a difference it made as we arrived around 8:45a.m. on a Sunday morning last month and there around 20-30 people crossing at a time at each of the intersections but within another half hour- hour 9:30a.m., there were over 75-100 people crossing at a time. The five intersections are absolutely a scene to watch from above from any building that offers such a viewpoint. We were fortunate to locate a seat at the Starbucks Tsutaya's 2nd floor and enjoy our drinks at the window to see all the non-stop pedestrian crossing at Shibuya Crossing during the change of lights. Even with such a crowd of people, it was very orderly and people crossed the street without any traffic jam issues. Definitely a show in itself in one of the world's busiest pedestrian crossing intersection.
You need to come here to see for yourself!",Tripadvisor
"The area of Arashiyama is pleasant enough to walk around if you can ignore the many many tourists - that's what the place is about, together with the related shopping.
Easy to get to.
There are temples and gardens and the view over the river and toward the hills would be great in 2-3 weeks when the leaves change.
The bamboo path is heavily touristed and whilst worth a look, is well overrated for mine. I would think you would need to be there pretty early to catch the light with a wide angle lens if you don't want others other than your lover in your IG photos - in contrast I think the river view would be preferred when the Autumn leaves are right.
Timing, they say, is everything.",Tripadvisor
"Come ogni attrazione meravigliosa del Giappone è piena di turisti. Se volete fare delle foto senza persone intorno dovete andare praticamente all'alba. Nonostante ciò, la bellezza di questo luogo lo rende comunque un must.
Per arrivare prendete il treno della linea sagano jr direttamente dalla stazione di kyoto, ci mette 15 minuti e costa davvero poco, scendere a saga arashiyama oppure arashiyama, sono molto vicine.
Se avete affittato una bici sappiate che sarete costretti a fare il percorso a piedi, che tra l'altro non è assolutamente in pianura. questo però vi permetterà di risparmiare tempo per muovermi da una parte all'altra della zona visto che ci sono anche altre attrazioni.
Le foto che scatterete, a meno che non siate fotografi professionisti, non renderanno mai la bellezza del luogo. Quando il vento soffia i bambù si muovono e fanno un suono incantevole..
Alla fine del percorso di bambu si trovano anche altre attrazioni, vicino scorre il fiume e lì anche è possibile fare belle foto panoramiche.

"Actually looking for the bamboo grove, google maps pointed us in the wrong direction, but we so happy it did!!! If you walk past the monkey park you will have the most beautiful trip almost to yourself. Follow the handpainted signs saying “Great view”. After about 1.5-2km you will go up this small visitors center and have an amazing view! Sit outside and enjoy the perfect peaceful sounds! Entrance is 400yen.",Tripadvisor
"Arashiyama is very beautiful during the cherry blossom and fall color seasons.
As you arrive to the town, stop at Togetsukyo Bridge and look at river, then head towards Tenryuji Temple and its beautiful garden. Behind them you have nice bamboo grove. Other temples at the area are: Daikakuji, Jojakkoji, Nisonin, Gioji, Adashino Nenbutsuji and Otagi Nenbutsuji temple. You can rent a bike at train stations, giving you easy way to get around temples. You can also have boat cruise on the river. If you want travel bit further, the Sagano Scenic Railway runs seven kilometers from Arashiyama to Kameoka, alongside the Hozu River.",Tripadvisor

"The Hakone Open-Air Museum was one of our top activities in our 2 week trip to Japan! Set in a beautiful, serene setting in the mountains, there were so many beautiful pieces of art. We went as two families, with children aged 7, 8, 10 and 10 and every single one of us loved it! There were tons of interactive pieces of art to keep the kids happy. In fact, we had to drag them out of the climbing net after 30 minutes! It’s a big area and you can easily spend 3 hours there. An absolute hit with adults and kids!

Tip: Just down the street is a gyoza restaurant. A perfect end to a long morning.",Tripadvisor
"The Hakone Open Air Museum is not what I expected. I thought it would be historical homes from the area, turns out it is more of a park with modern art. I'll be honest, I am not a fan of Modern Art, but I did enjoy this museum. The park itself was beautiful as was the surrounding area. The art is somewhat scattered throughout the park on random trails. Many exhibits were interactive making this place unique. It had fun things to do for both children and adults.",Tripadvisor
"worth a visit if you’re in the area. There are some very nice sculptures on the grounds with easily accessible walking paths.

The landscaping, distant views and the exhibits work together beautifully.

The Museum was exciting and conveyed ideas and concepts in a way that was accessible and interesting to kids and adults alike.",Tripadvisor
Fabulous setting and excellent collection of sculptures from many different artists. Nice cafe and shop. Easy access from the train station.,Tripadvisor
"Fantastic outside museum. Nice walk and great art. Picasso museum was a surprise and much better than one would expect, but really spectacular place to visit.",Tripadvisor
"First time to an open air museum and was blown away by the different installations. Many were very intriguing and was also engaging for the children. We spent a lot longer here than we expected. If not for the rush to the next destination, we could have spent at least 3 hours here. There is also a hot spring foot bath midway into the open air museum",Tripadvisor
"Brilliant museum! I absolutely loved this place. So many intriguing and interesting sculptures, set in beautiful surrounds. The foot spring was perfect for a little rest and the Picasso exhibition was a highlight.",Tripadvisor
The sculptures and landscape of this museum are amazing. We love how everything was put together - again showcasing how artistic and clever the Japanese are in their designs. The Picasso exhibition was also interesting. We love the stained glass tower the most due to its colour and the stories it tells. The grounds are so big that you can easily spend 2 hours here.,Tripadvisor
"Secondo me noi Italiani l’arte, l’abbiamo nel DNA. Ad Hakone ci ero andato tanti anni fa, ma stavolta oltre il lago Ashi, sono andato a vedere questo splendido museo all’aperto. Diciamo che se lo si vuol fare velocemente, 3 ore buone servono. Molte opere a livello mondiale, con tante cose accattivanti, non banali che catturano l’attenzione. Ci sono spazi dedicati anche a grandi maestri ed il percorso è molto ben organizzato. Mi ha colpito molto tutto quello che riguardava Tupera Tupera, veramente intrigante e colorato. Che dire, zona di sosta e relax, torre visitabile e trovarlo innevato, ne ha fatto una bella esperienza. Consigliato.",Tripadvisor
"This is a lovely open air museum with many interesting sculptures, the area is beautifully set out over the hills. The museum has some wonderful interactive pieces for children, many were having a ball. The museum has some indoor locations including one devoted to Picasso, which we found fascinating and learned a lot about the man. There is also a Cafe/restaurant.",Tripadvisor
Stopped by here for about an hour. It has some unique and beautiful sculptures and the stained glass tower is magnificent to stand in. While doing the Hakone loop - stop by and spend some time here. It wasn’t very crowded compared to everything else.,Tripadvisor
"I really loved this open-air museum in Hakone. I think it was the highlight of our trip. If I could go again tomorrow, I would.

Just a lovely walk in autumn and the sculpture collection was diverse and well curated for the outdoor climate. There was a small collection of Henry Moore; to my surprise and wonder being a small town of Hakone.

The Picasso building was also very interesting. Omoshiroi! Picasso’s pieces were not typical Picasso. It revealed his more divergent works; mainly ceramics with unusual applications.

Bring good shoes. The pathways are sloped. I did see a wheelchair; but it wasn’t easy.",Tripadvisor
"I enjoy but generally don't ""love"" museums, but this one was definitely an exception. The wide range and diversity of exhibits for all age groups ensured that you were engaged and attentive throughout. It also helps that it's located in a beautiful spot in Hakone, and on a sunny day, it looks amazing with the outdoor displays.",Tripadvisor
"I arrived around noon in Gora and was looking for things to do. As the options were limited I decided to visit this museum. If I had had more time, I'd probably done something different. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the way the museum is laid out and the artworks positioned in the landscape. If the weather is right and you have a few hours, thus is definitely a good option for the whole family.",Tripadvisor
"What an amazing place. I didnt expect it to be so cute. The kids loved it. The Picasso exhibit was just brilliant. I wish the weather had been better but we made the most of it.

Dont miss this !",Tripadvisor
"On a very wet day we visited this museum. From underneath our umbrellas we enjoyed wandering around the grounds. The art ranged from whimical to challenging and confronting, and some was just odd. The whole family found something to enjoy. The location was stunning with clouds rolling across the mountains and thunder booming in the distance. We stayed for a couple of hours.",Tripadvisor
"Make sure you include a visit here during your visit to Hakone. We did the ""Hakone Loop"" as a day trip from Tokyo. Without doubt, this was the highlight of our entire day. Far better than we had expected. You'll need at least 1.5 hours here. Don't skip it!",Tripadvisor
"Some fantastic sculptures set amongst lovely gardens. A very chilled few hours. Take the train from Hakone Yumoto if you can. This ride itself is an experience, with some great views.",Tripadvisor
"What a stunning place - not to be missed if you're in Hakone! Despite the amount of people that could be let in, the open space lets you appreciate every piece of art in your own time. Moves between contemporary, classical, and outdoor art.

The stained-glass tower is a showstopper 😍",Tripadvisor
Beautiful pieces of art by renowned artists and sculpture in a lovely open air garden setting. Spend an hour or so here before taking the ropeway to the volcano and lake Ashi.,Tripadvisor
"My brother suggested I visit because I was in the area, transiting between 2 overnight stays. So glad I did, this was such an unexpected bonus. Grounds were massive & so much to see. A wonderful walk thru the beautiful gardens & something new to see at every turn. Something for everyone - hard core art lovers - children - families - and ordinary everyday people who appreciate amazing art.",Tripadvisor
"this was near our accommodation – we were early for check in – had use of a rental car so popped in here to pass the time – and very pleased we did – set in manicured park surroundings there is a Main Gallery and in the open numerous statures and representations of modern sculpture, some difficult to understand but enjoyable all the same – restrooms dotted here and there, a stained glass tower which was stunning inside – a café - a place to rest your feet in a hot spring foot bath but the highlight is the Picasso Pavilion with two floors depicting his life and works – no additional entrance fee was payable here. Great place but you need good weather to enjoy it to its fullest",Tripadvisor
ピカソ館がリニューアルされたとのことで楽しみに訪問しました。芸術作品が点在する庭園をゆったり散策し、ピカソの作品を堪能。この作品数にしたら入場料は格安とも言えるでしょう。,Tripadvisor
Wow! This open air museum has everything. From Picasso works to a tower of stained glass. There is even moving artwork. Give yourself several hours to visit,Tripadvisor
We visited this museum and i enjoyed everything outside but not so much the exhibits that were inside.,Tripadvisor
"This would be better to do in the sunshine. We went while it was cold and rainy and it wasn't so enjoyable. Most of the exhibits were fine, but nothing too special. The one amazing exhibit was the glass tower. It is as beautiful as described in the advertisements for the museum. Worth visiting just for that.",Tripadvisor
"If you’re anywhere in the range of 300km make sure you dedicate some time to see this amazing museum.

It may take you one full day or only a few hours, depending how much time you want to spend, but great time is guaranteed.

Hakone Open Air museum features many interesting installations while museum parks provide special experience to the visitors with the variety of trees and some wildlife.

Museum has one of Arnoldo Pomodoro’s “Sfera con Sfera”, as well as many pieces from the ones like Picasso, Greco, Gargallo..",Tripadvisor
"Exceptional International Art and still very Japanese.
Top World Art in small Japanes village up in the mountains of Hakone Region.",Tripadvisor
"Absolutely stunning place with outdoor sculptures, art pieces & etc. Free outdoor foot bath. Bring either your own towel or buy one at 100 yen. No photography for indoor art exhibition, only for outdoors. Overall, fun & educational experience.",Tripadvisor
"I have to admit I'm not a huge fan of art, but I spent an interesting couple of hours in this Museum. There is something for everybody - from art that kids can play in to a whole collection of Picasso's works spanning his entire career. Well worth the stop at Chokokunomori station.",Tripadvisor
Spent 3 hours there and it’s a must visit. Kids will love it and adults can have a good stroll around this beautiful park. I would say even a great place for couples too. Not so crowded and a mini cafe to freshen up with some hot coffee before carrying on. Stroller friendly for sure.,Tripadvisor
"The huge indoor Picasso exhibition seems to be the main draw. I’m not into art, so I don’t really get the hype about Picasso. I enjoyed the outdoor exhibition more. It’s more interactive and kid friendly. Since it’s a open air museum, winter might not be the best time to visit as it’s freezing cold.",Tripadvisor
"Lovely park with many art sculptures including a pavilion dedicated to Picasso. A pleasant way to spend an afternoon if you appreciate the arts.
Tip: there's a tower with an amazing view inside of the stained glass walls; climb to the top for a view of the park.

"平日の午前に行ったが、学校振替の訪問者が多かったためか、
平日にしては混雑していた。
雨天の日は訪問を控えた方が良い施設。展示の8割以上は屋外。
入館料に見合った展示物だろう。

子供達に人気の「ネットの森」。
スタッフの監視はなく、音声で注意事項を流している。
そのため、ルールを無視する家族も多い。
特に、複数のグループで来ている人達。。。
保護者は一切子供達を見ていない。
走る、ボールを大きく揺らす、クッションを重ねる、ぶつかっても謝らない…言ったらきりがない。

我が子（小学校低学年）はネット内部の下方にいたが、ネット上方から落下した子供（おそらく小学校高学年）の下敷きになった。
もちろん、その子供や保護者からの謝罪はなし。

小学生以下の子供しか利用できないが、小学生未満は避けた方が良いだろう。

中でも幸せを呼ぶシンフォニー彫刻（ステンドグラスの塔）はとても綺麗で見ごたえがあり、必見です！",Tripadvisor
"I'm not generally a huge fan of outdoor sculpture, but in this beautiful setting, I did enjoying exploring the grounds and seeing the art.

The real treat for me was the Picasso Pavillion. I was terribly disappointed at the most recent exhibit I visited at the Picasso Museum in Paris - I found Hakone's presentation a vast improvement. I thought the displays and English signage were quite appropriate both for those very familiar with his life and work and for those new to Picasso.

I also enjoyed the Masterpiece Collection which I almost missed on my way out.

幸せを呼ぶシンフォニー彫刻は、陽が当たっていてとても綺麗でした。一通り見て回って大体2時間位。広いので歩き回って疲れましたが、行って良かったです。",Tripadvisor
Amazing!! The number and quality of the sculptures is so great. So much fun. The tower with the stain glass work is one of the greatest pieces of art that I have ever seen. This is truly a beautiful place.,Tripadvisor
C’est un splendide musée extérieur. Il y a une très grande variété d’œuvre d’art. Il y a un pavillon en hommage à Picasso.,Tripadvisor
The open air museum is an excellent experience. I would recommend about 3 hours to get around and see many of the exhibits. The gardens were an artwork in themselves,Tripadvisor
Very nice outdoor museum - the kids (8 and 5) loved it too and did not want to leave the „playground“ installation.,Tripadvisor
"This is a lovely outdoor sculpture museum, especially on a beautiful day. There are Rodins, Henry Moore and many others. Climb inside the stained glass tower to the top for a view of the area. Visit the Picasso exhibit as well. The grounds are very pretty and it is a nice way to spend the afternoon.",Tripadvisor
"I absolutely LOVED my visit to the Hakone Open-Air Museum and could have spent the whole day there.
The gardens, mature trees and surrounding mountains provide the perfect backdrop for the many large pieces created by artists from around the world. Yes, it helped that we visited on a bright spring day when the gardens and the art were at their brightest and most accessible. I can imagine that the experience could be quite different in the wet.
There is something here for all tastes from classical to whimsy. Signage is mostly in Japanese but QR codes link to English translations in many cases.
Among the many installations are a couple created just for kids, most notably the wonderful play space, ""Woods of Net'.
""Symphonic Sculpture"" is one of the museum's major attractions and once you enter the building and ascend the spiral staircase, it's easy to see why . The 18 metre high tower is walled in colourful stained glass by French artist Gabriel Loire and the staircase provides many vantage points from which to view it.
One of my favourite parts of the museum is the coy pond. Art installations here provide reflection and move in harmony with the fish and the surrounding tranquil, shaded gardens provide relief from other more crowded spaces.
On site is a cafe and restaurant and a museum shop with some great little gift pieces. We ate lunch in the restaurant which is near the exit and though we didn't expect much, the pizza and salad we shared were both really quite good.
The price of admission is less that AU$20. Great value.",Tripadvisor
"Our guidebook described this museums as “unmissable” and it was indeed a great experience. There are a number of neat sculptures and installations spread across a large garden area, plus a couple of indoor exhibits including one focused on Picasso’s work only. There is a nice Western style restaurant by the exit and a quaint cafe on the grounds. The museum is just a couple of minutes walk from the train station on the Hakonetozan line, included on the Hakone free pass ticket - or if you don’t want to buy the pass, just use your IC/Pasmo card.",Tripadvisor
"Worth the trip! Loved every minute. A gorgeous, well designed open air museum. If I’m in the area again, I will go again. Highly recommend.",Tripadvisor
"This is an open museum, a very wide area, lots of statues scattered in the area, a combination with the cherry blossoms makes the experience one of a kind.
There is a Picasso display, a space for children as well as a tower decorated with glass works
Unfortunately, we had limited time, but we managed to get an impression of a well-kept and very impressive place, also suitable for children
There is also a souvenir shop",Tripadvisor
"The best and most amazing Open Air museum!

Sprawling lawns, impeccably manicured united with unique art forms. Some serious, others whimsical. Cherry blossoms 🌸 were in full bloom...so lucky! They added a touch of elegance to the art displays.

The kaleidoscope building!!! AKA the Symphonic Sculpture and it's curved staircase was the most impressive. Loved every light ray coming through the brilliantly coloured stained glass walls. Luminous 💕 Almost enlightening!

Hope to return it was one of the most enjoyable sites we visited in Hakone.",Tripadvisor
This is a wonderful open air museum - it is easy to navigate and not so large that is necessary to spend a lot of time there. We spent about 1.5 hours there and found that to be sufficient,Tripadvisor

"Me and my wife visit this special Shrine on our second day in, and it was very long day as this Fushimi Inari-taisha Shrine in Kyoto is very huge and to discover it takes long time, and you have to be physically fit as the walking paths are ups and downs and mostly if your not fit will be a challenge to discover the beauty of this place. all the orange colored entrance ""Shrine"" are individual donated by different personals. I was very pressed of the landscape and how the arrangements of the Shrine been set and the explanation.
I recommend to have a guide if you are none Japanese in order to understand the writings on the Shrine.
Should not miss to visit this beautiful Fushimi Inari-taisha Shrine.",Tripadvisor

"This shrine is unlike anything you will see anywhere else in the world.
It is stunning, it is vast, and it is in a beautiful location.
Very easy to get to, just 2 train stops from Kyoto Station (covered by JR Travel Pass) and easy to find when you get off the frain.
To walk right to the top and back will take about an hour, it is a decent workout but not too arduous.
It's set in a beautiful forest on the mountainside, and it's a very pleasant place to visit. There are literally hundreds of side-shrines to visit, and the photo opportunities are limitless.
It is a bit crowded at the start, but it seems that most people don't do the full circuit, so if you just keep walking you will soon be able to enjoy the site without crowds.
It is a wondrous place.
And it's free!",Tripadvisor

"Fushimi Inari Shrine is definitely worth going for taking selfies with the Tori gates, it's a way way long walk up the mountain. Once you reach a stop point where the lookout is, just go have a look, take some pics then go back down coz there is absolutely nothing to see up the top, no view over looking the city or anything, nothing worth the effort. Just go back down and keep your energy to your next destination. And no matter how busy and crowded people are, you will always find a spot to take pics of the tori gates without people as long as you are patient.",Tripadvisor

"千本鳥居が有名で、ずっと行きたくて今回初めて伺いました。
時期と、朝早く（7時）にいったせいか、ほとんど人がおらず自分のペースでのんびりお参りすることが出来ました。
千本鳥居前には、本社や、おもかる石など、見どころがあり時間がない方にはここでも十分楽しめます。
千本鳥居はとても神聖な雰囲気に包まれています。
初めはよくインスタ映えしてる緩やかな傾斜が続きますが、次第に坂道、階段、登山…といった感じになってきます。
なので、着物で来た方、ヒールで来た方は初めの帰り道のお知らせあたりで戻るのをオススメします。
私は、頑張って四つ辻までいきましたが、日頃の不摂生の為、大変足が疲れました…
四つ辻からの眺めは最後の画像を確認下さい。
凄くいい！というわけではありませんが、登った達成感は得られました。
四つ辻には、俳優の西村和彦さんのご実家のお茶屋さんもあるので、開店時間にいけばお茶などが注文できます。（残念ながら開店前でした）
更に奥には奥社などがあるので体力に自信のある方は是非ご参拝下さい",Tripadvisor
"Quick ride from Kyoto station. The hike itself was nice and calm. It may be strenuous for some as a portion of it is uphill. No entrance fee was required. On your way up, there is a nice, little stop with a great views where you can take a break with ice cream, coffee etc. Upon reaching the top, do not expect spectacular views, there are none. Still a good experience.",Tripadvisor

"My partner and I did this while we were in Kyoto for a short time. We heard going at dusk/night was better as all the tourists leave and locals are just left, which is what we did and what we got.

After the train station, they had food stalls near the entrance which we encourage you to try. Fair warning there is a lot of walking involved so you need to wear proper shoes but the sites of Kyoto especially at night at the summit after walking through the torii gates is worth it.",Tripadvisor

Wonderful park. The Picasso exhibit was great. The sculptures dotting the grounds were fantastic. The Symphonic Structure was beautiful and full of great opportunities for photos. Totally unexpected for an area that is seemingly only known for spas and views of Mount Fuji. Plan to spend 2-3 hours or more enjoying the scenery.,Tripadvisor

Two of the main halls were closed for renovations but we still had to pay admission fee with a minimum discount, despite having a Hakone pass which is advertised as ""including access to some attractions, inc. the Open Art Museum"". Be aware you'd still have to pay admissions to those regardless, it's really misleading.",Tripadvisor

"We had high expectations and expected something similar to Millesgarden Museum in Stockholm and we were not disappointed. It is easily accessed by car or train from the Gora Station.
There is an indoor museum that features some unique collections and a large outdoor sculpture park. There is a nice easy walk around the gardens and its many sculptures. Some of the early pieces such as Man and Pegasus and the Weeper were great as was the Sphere within a sphere. There was a Picasso pavilion. One of the highlights was the Symphonic Sculpture with a giant sun on the front. This was a tall observation tower and once inside we discovered the interior walls were completely covered in stained glass. It was a tremendous visual experience. Much of the glass was flowing colours and patterns but then we started to spot specific images throughout such as a heart, knight, car, owl and so on. It was quite a discovery.
Near the Symphonic Sculpture is a great little cafe and small gift shop. There is plenty of green space and nothing feels too cluttered or untidy. We enjoyed it immensely.",Tripadvisor
Worth checking out. We did the walk to the top of the mountain. It's pretty much more of the same from a shrine perspective but you get a good view of Kyoto and can see Osaka in the distance on a clear day. The walk up the mountain has a fair few steps so that's worth taking into account.,Tripadvisor

"As we walked out from Fushimi Inari Station, we followed the crowds and took some pics of the big lovely temple in front of the station, with its majestic torri gate.
Then, we walked along a small street with many quaint Japanese houses and came across a food section where many varieties of food were sold.
After enjoying some food and resting, we walked on. We failed to find the entrance to the orange torri gates and Shrine. We tried asking some locals but were not successful with the directions given.
In the end, we gave up because we visited Arashiyama Bamboo Forest that morning and our legs were so tired.
We immediately regretted not persevering as we entered the JR train to return to Kyoto, but it was too late. Beats us how we could've failed to find it when so many others mention its proximity to the station.
Anyway, we told ourselves, this would be a good reason to come back to Kyoto again, to visit Fushimi Inari Shrine! But we must be fully prepared with really clear directions on how to reach it.",Tripadvisor
"外国人観光客でごった返す最低のスポットに成り下がりました。

商売の神様として、三が日は日本で3本の指に入る人気の大社でしたが、今では日本人はほとんどおらず外国人観光客だらけです。

特に、大声を張りあげて歩きながら食べ物を食い荒らす中国人観光客の傍若無人さに呆れるばかりです。

参道の商店はお金を落としてくれる外国人観光客により潤っているようですが、地域住民の反感は非常に高いです。

すでに日本ではなくなっている残念スポットです。",Tripadvisor
"Detour from Osaka, more or less an hour of train ride to the Fushimi-Inari Station. Definitely one of the key attractions when you think of Kyoto. Crowded as expected. And the thousands of tore gates were definitely spectacular.",Tripadvisor
"A long walk if you can tackle the whole mountain unfortunately we only made it half way but still a nice experience , good culture and a few photo spots ... you will need to time it right tho as there are lots of visitors here

"It really nice to walk trough the area, especially trough the torii gates. The only negative thing was the hustle and bustle in general, because during my visit it was very crowded. So I didn‘t spend that much time in there and increased the pace a bit.",Tripadvisor
"平日にかかわらず観光客多い。
龍谷大学前バス停バス停からどっちに歩いて行くと大社なのか分かりにくい。看板があればいい。",Tripadvisor
バスを降りて大社まで、狭い歩道を進みます。海外の観光客が多い道は、冬でも混雑しています。ほどなく神社に着きました。稲荷大社なので、お稲荷さんが祀られているのですが、朱塗りの美しい千本鳥居が近年写真スポットとして人気があるのです。この鳥居は神社に寄付した方により建てられた物なのですが、実際には千本は無いらしいとのことでした。でもやはり朱塗りの鳥居か隙間無く並ぶ様は圧巻です。,Tripadvisor

"新型コロナの影響もあり、京都は外国人観光客

Es un santuario que llama al alma a observar y abstraerse del día a día exterior. Sus millares de puertas hacen el recorrido hasta el santuario unpaseo de repaso de la cultura milenaria de Japón.,Tripadvisor
Muy recomendable! Es un recorrido de alrededor 1.5 horas pero vale la pena! De preferencia hacer el recorrido en la tarde o muy temprano,Tripadvisor
仕事で京都へ行ったので、近くの観光スポットである伏見稲荷大社へ寄ってみました。昨今のウイルスの問題もあり、海外からの旅行者の人も少ないようで、ゆっくりと千本鳥居を歩きながら撮影できました。でも、山頂までは思った以上の距離と時間で、暗くなってきたこともあり途中で断念。鳥居の絵馬は面白いと思いました。,Tripadvisor
"インバウンドさん達に大人気の千本鳥居の伏見稲荷大社ですが、新型肺炎の影響で海外のお客さんが少いと聞き、チャンスじゃないかと10数年振りに行ってみました。

休日だったのでそこそこ観光客はいましたが、それでも余裕で山頂まで上がることができました。

一の峰のお参りと山頂付近の御朱印に少し並びましたが10分程度でした。

千本鳥居といいますが、きっと千本どころではない数の鳥居をくぐります。
また、小さい鳥居を奉納できるようなので、そこかしこが鳥居だらけでもう何だか訳がわからないです。

山の中の「こんなところにまで！」(山頂にも)
というところに点々と茶店や食堂があります。

「京○」というお店の外観の写真を撮っていると、お店の人にすっごいイケズな顔で怒られました。
あー怖かった～",Tripadvisor
I think only people who believe in shrines should visit for us it was tiring and the views from the top of the mountain well nothing to write home about. Waste of time.,Tripadvisor
"Should be anyone’s list for a visit to Tokyo. Good vantage points are the station, a well-known coffee shop and the crossing points themselves",Tripadvisor
緑豊かな園内をお散歩しながら、彫刻を鑑賞できます。平日ということもあり、人も多くなくゆったりと観れました。お子様連れの方は、子供が遊べるアスレチックやそういったエリアがあるので遊ばせてる人も多かったです。中にはピカソ館もあり見応えがありよかったです。私は2時間もあれば一通り見ることができました。夕方閉館です。,Tripadvisor
雨にも負けず、来てみました。やはり素晴らしい。特に幸せを運ぶシンフォニーのステンドグラスは、何度見ても最高です。,Tripadvisor
Perfect setting for my now 7th favorite art museum on the planet. Each turn provides a perfectly placed sculpture for visual delight and contemplation. Plenty to see to justify effort required to get there.,Tripadvisor
"This is the first time ever that I enjoyed seeing sculptures a lot. I fell in love at this place!! It's definitely more than just a museum. They have everything, from interactive rooms and amazing play areas where family can enjoy (young, teens, and adults), to the beautiful scenery with wonderful crafted structures. It just relaxing in the eyes. The foot bath is a huge plus. For me, the Picasso museum is the highlight of this place. Who would've thought that 300 of Picasso's original artworks are stored in this place in Japan.

Perfect setting and wonderful place to see!

Elementary school kids and below can enter for free on weekends. They have lots of parking space (indoor and outdoor). Don't forget to validate your parking ticket once you pay for the admission fee so you don't need to pay a dime for parking. Everything is at reasonable price. Highly recommended!",Tripadvisor
Unique and beautiful ....the getting there is part of the thrilling adventure. Even though its been 5 years it was a lifetime thrill.,Tripadvisor
"25年ぶりくらいに行きました。
何年経っても変わらない景色、行き届いたメンテナンス、素晴らしいです。

展望レストランからの眺めも素晴らしかったけど、スタッフに外国人がいて、接客がまるでダメ。

いらっしゃいませ、ありがとうございました、の一言すら言えない人を雇ってはダメ。",Tripadvisor
"But most of it was outside. They server really good soft serve ice cream for like 400 yen, defo get some of that. The ticket was cheap I think and they spoke English. Lots of art everywhere and you can look at it. Pretty good tbh.",Tripadvisor
"We went to this ‘museum’ just as it opened (9am) on a Wednesday morning. It was pretty warm but cloudy. We couldn’t believe what a high quality gallery/museum this is. The sculptures are nearly all outdoors, so maybe if it’s scorching hot or wet or cold it might not be as good, however when we went it was perfect. Also, we felt that we had the place almost to ourselves for the first 30 mins, which was really special!

The garden/landscaping is superb and as you go around you discover new delights around every corner. I know this sounds cheesy but it’s true. I’m no sculpture buff but I found plenty of interesting and exciting pieces.

Coffee at the lovely air-conditioned cafe was top notch. It’s also worth noting that the museum has luggage lockers out front for a deposit of 100 yen. We went on our last day in Hakone and we stashed our luggage here, saw the museum and then had lunch before collecting our bags. We spent 2.5 hours looking round. Couldn’t recommend it highly enough.",Tripadvisor
We spent about 3 and 1/2 hours walking around and taking fun photos of the sculptures. Stopped for coffee at the cafe near the Picasso exhibit. Parking discount to ¥500 was very nice too.,Tripadvisor
"箱根登山鉄道を登って彫刻の森駅で降りて5分ほど歩くと到着。
多くの彫刻がいい感じで立ち並び、箱根の山々ととてもうまく調和しています。
お気に入りは、ニキ・ド・サン・ファールさんのミス・ブラック・パワー。
でもどれもすてきです。
ピカソ館もピカソの説明が多くあり、楽しめました。
出口付近で自分の顔を使ったコンピューターグラフィックもとても面白いので是非。",Tripadvisor
"I was so impressed with this museum however, I would call it The Hakone Open-air Art Gallery.
To access the art you walk around beautiful park like gardens.
We had allowed 2 hours to view what we thought was a museum and found that we had to rush in order to get around. I would have enjoyed a further hour here at least.
There are several interactive “art” pieces that children could play in as well as some fun digital displays.
We found the food at the cafe okay but really expensive.",Tripadvisor
"Wonderful gardens to walk around, see sculptures as the artist intended. Picasso exhibit was added bonus, aAndy Gorman bonus. Great shop and overall spend time here to take it all in",Tripadvisor
"Beautifully laid out. Audio guides available. Separate building for an extensive collection for Picasso and an area where you can relax and soak your feet in natural hot spring water. There's a wood 'hive' structure several stories tall with netted curved space just for kids. Go in and up the stained glass, symphonic sculpture!",Tripadvisor
"Very nice garden setting, art to discover and explore (and climb on, if you are 12 or under). We spent more than 2 hours here and it was clearly more than worth the visit.",Tripadvisor
"Vale la pena dormire nelle vicinanze anche e solo una notte per poter godere di questo gioiello.
Una quantità incredibile di eccellenti opere d’arte in totale sintonia con la natura circostante.
Pulito, civile e ordinato, come solo sanno essere i luoghi giapponesi.
E poi il padiglione dedicato a Picasso è stato riaperto da pochissimo: una meraviglia nella meraviglia",Tripadvisor
it is rare to visit a museum and the kids do not want to get out. They played a lot in the installations and Art-Experiences in the park. Really an amazing place to visit with your kids. even below 12 years old.,Tripadvisor
Lindas obras de arte . Local muito bem cuidado nos mínimos detalhes. Os jardins são tratados por jardineiros que fazem um trabalho minucioso. Vimos um especialista retocando uma das obras e sua técnica nos impressionou.,Tripadvisor
"Really surprised to see such an extensive open air, modern sculpture collection in the hills of a spa town in Japan. It's absolutely fantastic and easily rivals similar ones that I've seen in the US and in Europe. Absolutely worth a visit, but absolutely be prepared to walk a lot, as the grounds are a bit sprawling and some of the pieces involve making your way up stairs or small hills to get the full effect.",Tripadvisor
"We had a really lovely afternoon at this unique outdoors museum. The setting is wonderful, really special to be able to regard these works of art against the Hakone mountain backdrop. Although we have no kids with us we were really impressed at how kid friendly this museum is. But it's the 2000 individual works of art which are the real appeal, a really nice Picasso exhibition and numerous other objects by artists around the world that both challenge and reward you.

Highly recommended",Tripadvisor
Full array of wonderful sculptures from all the famous names around the world all set in delightful tranquil gardens. Beautifully thought through. We loved it,Tripadvisor
"If you are near Hakone, visit this museum. It is beautiful and interesting. Probably not a good option for a very cold or rainy day. We all enjoyed ourselves and spent about 4 hours at the museum.",Tripadvisor
Beautiful outside art museum. Sculptures were truly beautiful. Large outside grounds exceptionally well maintained. It’s a real experience walking around seeing all the different,Tripadvisor
"The sun was out after a few days of Typhoon rain and my kids and I loved the outdoor experience. There was something for everyone, quiets spaces and the amazing Horiuchi MacAdam knitted playground which my 7 year old lost his mind over!
We spent a whole day there and the bullet trained back to Tokyo, having left our luggage in the great locker space at the front of the museum after overnighting in Hakone.
The public transport here is very easy to access, however, do leave enough time to wait for trains in busy times as once they are full and you may have to wait for the next train. The Hakone Free pass make this seemless, and easy to get around.",Tripadvisor
"Very interesting museum. If weather allows it is well worth it.

Picasso exhibit was great also. Easy to get to from train station. Our favorite day thing to do in Hakone.",Tripadvisor
Dozens of modern sculptures outside in a magnificent setting. Unexpected pleasures. Allow two hours to get through.,Tripadvisor
"We visited this museum with a little trepidation, as it was raining fairly heavily but there was plenty to see indoors in the Picasso exhibition and we wandered around the display of sculptures outside with raincoats and umbrellas and thoroughly enjoyed the morning. It was beautifully and thoughtfully laid out. A lovely surprise.",Tripadvisor
Brilliant outdoor museum. Very interactive and great Picasso exhibition. Nice foot bath too. Really good for kids too.,Tripadvisor

"Hakone is a wonderful place to visit and trying out all the various modes of transportation to get around was a unique experience. Arriving at the Open-Air Museum was a highlight of our day and although the weather was cold and windy and things weren't very green yet, it was fun to explore. Worth the effort to stop by for sure... our kids enjoyed the many visual/experiential surprises throughout the museum.",Tripadvisor

"Au bord du lac d'Ashi se trouve un des musées (le mot ici est trop réducteur) les plus originaux au monde. Une collection de sculpture allant de l'art moderne (Bourdelle, Léger) jusqu'à l'art contemporain. Dans un parc en plein air dans un jardin parfaitement dessiné, se succèdent au gré du parcours végétal des sculptures remarquablement intégrées dans le paysage. De toute évidence l'équipe muséographique n'a rien raté de sa mission artistique. En proposant un parcours sculpturalement éclectique (ou l'abstrait cotoie le figuratif), les scénographes vous entraînent dans une promenade au cœur d'une nature en parfaite harmonie avec les œuvres exposées. Une réussite. L'instant zen de votre voyage au Japon à 2h de Tokyo.",Tripadvisor

"Op een warme middag in mei besloten wij toch de beeldentuin te bezoeken. Helaas was het Picasso huis gesloten ivm renovatie maar de beeldentuin is prachtig!
Het is mooi en wijds opgezet als een park. Je loopt rustig tussen alle kunstwerken van internationale kunstenaars als Miro en Moore, door omgeven door natuur. Dit park is ook zeker leuk voor kinderen. Een aantal objecten is echt voor kinderen gemaakt/aangepast en ze mogen er op en in klimmen en klauteren. Erg indrukwekkend vond ik de toren van glasmozaïek.
Echt een aanrader in Hakone",Tripadvisor
"Realmente fuimos porque no teníamos mucho más que hacer en Hakone. Habían cosas curiosas y lo más del museo era la zona de Picasso, y la verdad que siendo de Málaga nos pareció bastante pobre.",Tripadvisor
"Ce musée dépoussière les autres musées et met l’art contemporain à la portée de tous, au sens propre et figuré.

C’est un parc magnifique en face d’un beau panorama (sauf si la météo est pluvieuse), où on se promène entre plusieurs bâtiments sur des chemins serpentant entre des sculptures variées de grands artistes, à peine séparé par un cordon au ras des mollets. On se sent libre d’approcher et de tourner tranquillement entre les œuvres majestueuses et on peut pénétrer dans certaines - dont une où un escalier à double colimaçon amène à une terrasse dominant une partie du parc - ou jouer dedans pour les plus petits.

La collection Picasso se trouve dans un bâtiment et dans un autre, il y a un café et au dessus des sculptures plus petites et intimes. À côté de ce dernier, on peut prendre un bain de pied avec de l’eau chauffée par le volcan proche tout en admirant les œuvres : une expérience incroyable.",Tripadvisor

距離箱根登山火車站走路約一百公尺，也可以搭巴士抵達。非常喜歡美術館的陳列，很多大型展品都在室外，喜歡拍照或者怪奇物品的人一定會喜歡這裡！雖然夏天來真的是有點熱，但還是逛得很開心！走累的話也是有室內展覽館可以稍微休息，吹個冷氣。真的無法具體陳述這個雕刻美術館的感覺，總之如果有拜訪箱根或強羅，一定要去這裡走走！,Tripadvisor

"All'interno di un parco tenuto veramente alla perfezione è possibile ammirare varie sculture di diverso genere ed artista. E' molto piacevole camminare sui vialetti alberati e soffermarsi ad ammirare le singole opere. All'interno, museo nel museo, anche una sezione dedicata a Picasso: peccato che, con all'esterno una temperatura percepita di 40° C ne tengano all'interno 15° C, rendendo impossibile e sconsigliabile soffermarsi più di tanto.",Tripadvisor

"We lucked out and had a beautiful day to enjoy the museum, which definitely added to our experience. It is very well done with the outdoor sculptures, the lawns, the trees, etc. all set against the beautiful green mountain scenery. We had a nice leisurely stroll, taking in the outdoor artwork, which is nicely spread out. The Picasso exhibit was very good. The foot bath was a nice relaxing rest part way through our visit.",Tripadvisor
"This was part of a trip to Hakone, the gardens are beautiful and we saw them at there best on a sunny day. As the title says it is an Open-air museum so most exibits are outside. The picasso exibit is indoors but the venue is so much more than pissaco. well worth a visit",Tripadvisor
Nous avons parcouru ce musée avec bonheur malgré la pluie. C’est vraiment superbe. Le cadre naturel est dingue et les œuvres sublimes. Je recommande (même sous la pluie !),Tripadvisor
This was included in our tour and we were so thankful it was. The Picasso Exhibition within the complex is fabulous and follows his work through the years with an incredible display within the building where it is housed. The park has some great works of art and anyone visiting should allow at least 2 hours to take it all in. We also had lunch in the Restaurant upstairs. We avoided the buffet and went for the a-la-carte which we found very good and at a reasonable price.,Tripadvisor
"The Hakone Open-Air Museum is a great place to get away from the big cities and have a relaxing outdoor walk, surrounded by world-class modern art. The setting is wonderful.

"This was our first stop on our trip after arriving at Haneda, train to hakone yumoto and then by bus to open air museum (OAM). We printed the discount coupon available on the internet and saved 100yen. The bus stop was right in front of the museum entrance. We spent around 1.5 hours here.

The displays were very good, interesting and unique. It's a worthwhile place to visit and spend time absorbing the works.

Had tea coffee at the cafe and there was a foot bath. Just need to pay for the towels at a dispenser. After the excursion, we walk back to the same bus stop and took a direct bus to Gora where our hotel is. Every thing for ghid first stop on our itinerary worked out according to our expectations. It's our first trip to hakone and we heard so much and read so much about this OAM and we're not disappointed at all. A must see for any first time visitor to hakone.

"On a vraiment été sous le charme de ce musée magnifique ! Les sculptures sont disposés avec goût et intelligence, pratiquement chaque pièce mérite qu’on s’y arrête une demi-heure, l’entretien du parc et le pavillon Picasso sont entretenus à la perfection. Vraiment à recommander!!!",Tripadvisor
"We were lucky to be there on a dry day, I wouldn't recommend visiting on a very wet day because almost all of the sculptures are outside. I thought the range was very impressive and include several Henry Moore's & and at least one Hepworth (so the British were well represented). I must be the only person who wasn't very keen on the Picasso gallery, it just seemed to be a collection of unimportant pieces. The gardens were lovely but needed a bit of work (especially weeding).
We enjoyed the buffet lunch in the restaurant - basically eat as much as you wish from a very substantial number of options including serve yourself ice cream for a reasonable price.It's possible to get there using the Hakone Tozan Train so you could take the opportunity to both ride the switchback train and visit the museum.",Tripadvisor

"There's a discount if you have the Hakone free pass. There are many great sculptures in the park as well as indoor exhibits and activity area (for kids). Kids also have an outdoor diamond maze and a Net of Wood attraction to play in. This time if year, they have a night museum activity which starts at 1645. This transforms the sculptures through the effect of lighting. There is also a warm foot bath. Bring a towel or buy for Y100. 2 hour plus required.",Tripadvisor
"You need to visit this unique museum to experience the joy of walking through the beautiful grounds, the appreciation of artistic displays and the laughter of children interspersed in every corner. This place was indescribably beautiful during my visit because autumn leaves dotted the space with hues of yellow, red, orange and brown. Definitely worth a leisurely visit!",Tripadvisor
"A great chance to review many great pieces of art including some Picasso works. If you love art, perhaps a full day. Access through the sight can be difficult if you are not mobile. Steep areas and uneven paths. Plenty of photos and suggest starting onsite at 9am to be the crowds and get the morning light. There is some food onsite and a great sushi restaurant adjacent to the entrance towards the bus / train stations.",Tripadvisor

箱根の温泉で一泊した翌日に立ち寄りました。駐車場に入ってから出るまで１時間かからず、スピーディー。チケット購入時に駐車券を見せると５時間まで５００円になる割引があり、十分過ぎるぐらいです。ネットの森で小学生に突き落とされた３歳の娘はギャン泣き。突き落とした小学生は謝る様子もなく、更に娘を邪魔扱い。ギャン泣きの娘を抱えて退館。当初は１泊したあと夕方ぐらいまで遊ぶ予定でしたが、そのまま帰宅することになったので、家でのんびりできました。小さな子供を遊ばせてはいけないなら表示しておいてほしい。,Tripadvisor

More,there is a pavillion dedicated to Picasso showing a nice and representing sempling of his works and another pavillion housing tha famous ""Kiss"" by Brancusi and the chairs are the wishbone model..
No doubt ;spending there a few hours was not wasting my time",Tripadvisor

全然違う人の違う作品なのに、対になってるようにみえるものもあったりして、配置にも工夫を感じました。",Tripadvisor
"The open air museum tries to harmonize art and its natural surroundings through well placed artefact's. It has several sections of open air art and some indoors including moving exhibitions and a children's area. The Henry Moore is among the well known open air artefact's while Picasso's large collection has created a nice indoor space for viewing too.
Its a fascinating place to spend a day enjoying its scenic beauty and the art within. Ticket price is over 1000yen per head",Tripadvisor
"We didn't realize Hakone is a bit of an art focused region, and the Hakone Open-Air Museum should really be considered one of the finest sculpture gardens in the world, with a hundred or so Picassos thrown into the bargain. This is worth every yen and two to three hours of your time.",Tripadvisor

"We almost didn't go because the weather was cold, windy and rainy but we had an amazing time. It is not like a typical sculpture garden. It is beautifully laid out. Very architectural and filled with unexpected works of famous artists including an entire building devoted to Picasso ceramics. Who knew! Don't miss it if you are in the area. PLan to spend at least a morning or an afternoon. It'll be a highlight of your trip.",Tripadvisor
"Two hours was barely long enough for this amazing place, especially with two children who didn’t want to leave each of the Kid Art attractions! The museum was really an art gallery, with sculptures scattered around the beautifully kept grounds, with the bonus of a Picasso exhibition building. Even though the weather was a little drizzly, it was still a pleasure to wander the exhibits. For the kids, there were underground stairs, a spider web of ropes, a climbing box, though the maze was closed. On the way to the exit was a chance for the kids (and adults) to be ‘living sculptures’ with three further activities. Even the gift shop was well stocked with a wide variety of items. This attraction doesn’t seem to have the publicity it deserves! It’s a ten minute walk from the Hakone railway station.",Tripadvisor
"We went into town to see the Hakone Museum of Art because of our interest in ceramics. We had some time after lunch and decided to walk over to the Open Air Museum (without having really researched it). We were blown away. Beautiful setting, well curated pieces. The two hours we had left were not enough to really appreciate everything. And this was on a cold, drizzling day. Can't imagine how nice it must be when the sun is out.",Tripadvisor

The whole island is wonderful, from the temple, the deers, the magical streets all the way to the top of Mount Misen.

Mount Misen was one of the highlights for us though please make sure to reserve enough time if you plan to hike up on foot. It's quite a rough hike as it's mostly only tall rocky stairs, moreover, the temple complex on the way is wonderful and quite large. We spent there unexpectedly lot of time and then didn't have enough time to reach the top before the last ropeway which left having to hike down absolutely exhausted and in the dark.",Tripadvisor

"While staying in Hiroshima we took the opportunity to visit Miyajima Island which is famous for the floating torii gate and the Itsukushima Shrine which is also just above water when the tide is in. As it is an island it is only possible to get there by boat but its a pleasant ride from Hiroshima and of course you get to see the shrine & gate from the sea.
Unfortunately when we were there the floating gate was covered in scaffolding and plastic sheets so we couldn't see it but the shrine was fascinating.
The Itsukushima shrine is not the only attraction on the island and I strongly recommend visting the Daisho-in Temple where there are a hundreds of Buddhist statues all wearing a knitted hats and while you're there don't miss the Henjokutsu Cave which is amazing.
While there we also took the ropeway up Mount Misen to take in the view.
Between the ferry port and the shrine there are streets lined with places to eat and shops to buy souveniers. We took the opportunity to eat a local dish called okonomiyaki (basically a stuffed pancake), it was worth sitting in the restaurant just to watch it made right in front of you but it was also delicious and cheap.",Tripadvisor
"Just a short train and ferry ride will get you to Miyajima. Famous for the floating tori gate, Isukushima Shrine, Daisho-n Temple and the many traditional Japanese buildings. Watch out for the many deer as they will grab things out of your hands ( my JR pass). Lots of good eateries and many good shops. We also traveled at the wrong time as the floating gate was covered in plastic having repairs done. We had a great day out and recommend this trip to everyone.",Tripadvisor

"Miyajima Island famous for Floating Torii Gate which is become tourism icon of Miyajima and Hiroshima Prefecture.

Unfortunately when I got there the sea water was receding. However I was lucky to be able to walk near the Torii Gate. It was clearly that this Torii Gate wood was old,sturdy and strong that it was still resistant to wind, storm and sea water. Many threw coins near Torii as a symbol of good luck.

Along the road to the temple there are many deers, but not as many as in Nara and are more benign. Many souvenir shop and food stalls as well. Don't miss to try Hiroshima culinary like fish cake, momoji manju, okonomiyaki, oyster crackers and grilled oysters for ¥ 500.The Oysters bigger and given pieces of lime.

To get to Miyajima with JR Sanyo Line from Hirosima Station stop at Mitajimaguchi Station.Next take JR Ferry to Miyajima Island.
Both covered with JR Pass.",Tripadvisor
People travel from all over the world to see this Torii and it will be under renovation for two years. The island is still packed with people looking for things to do. Shops are open for business with many overcharging for their goods. I still kept myself entertained with a couple hikes in the hills.,Tripadvisor

Plenty of Shrines and temples to visit, a maple tree park and even a small aquarium. Definitely worth a day's visit. Can start or end at the shopping and food street near the ferry terminal. The deers roaming around does remind me of Nara. Note that the Red Torii gate is currently under repair so it is all covered up.",Tripadvisor
Don’t rush - catch the street car from Hiroshima and then the ferry across to the island. The main part of town was very busy with tourists but there are enough side streets and wonderful temples and shrines dotted around the island. We spent the whole day there and didn’t regret it. It would be lovely to stay overnight.,Tripadvisor

"Quite simply a must do in Japan.

I went there 5 years ago and thought a second visit may not reward me as it it did on the first visit. But I was wrong, it was just as good second time around.

Take the JR ferry for no cost when you use your JR Pass. A 10 minute ferry trip drops you off at a site where you can visit the renowned gate in the ocean,ancient temples and pagodas, a cable car up the mountains and some of the best views in Japan.

The shops are incredibly quaint and there is a multitude of beautiful walks that place you in contact with the local semi-tame deer that seem to be everywhere.",Tripadvisor
"Island off hiroshima. JR rail pass covers the train and ferry to the island.

We missed the famous red shrine in the water as it was covered in scaffold for repairs. Several temples to visit, try the huge oysters (2 for 500y ), take the ropeway to the mountain summit for great views, deers everywhere.

In November all the leaves are turning to reds, yellows and purples. Very impressive.

A little touristy but definitely worth a visit.",Tripadvisor

Ga ergens lunchen en wandel dan weer verder. Het uitzicht boven op de berg is zo de moeite, adembenemend mooi. laat je niet haasten maar neem je tijd. Heel erg mooi.",Tripadvisor

F. PHOTOGRAPHY : Allowed,
The island of Miyajima is located in the inland sea of Japan. The island houses famous ITSUKUKUSHIMA Shrine a UNESCO World Heritage Site built in 12th century . The shrine houses number of Shinto temples. Toyokuni Shrine with five storied pagoda, Dalganji temple, which is one of most famous in Japan. The famous 16 metre Red coloured Torii gate, also known as floating gate built within the sea.
We visited this place during our recent Japan trip. We travelled from Osaka on a day trip. The ferry ride is smooth and pleasant. The view of the Torii gate within the sea near the island coast is great. The island with it's hillock in the background covered with green foliage looks beautiful. The 15 minutes walk on the coastal road to the Shrine is truly pleasant. The wild deers roam freely and are quite friendly and ready for a photo shoot. The five storied pagoda, the wooden Dalganji temple complex, the Torii gate built on the sea bed are worth visit. The shopping street has number of Souvenir shops and eateries. You must try local speciality maple leaf pastry and oysters.

"Our #2 ❤️ site near Hiroshima!

We visited Miyajima Island during the later afternoon. Arrived by fast ferry offered by the Hiiroshima World Heritage Sea Route. Departed from the bridge, near the Atomic Dome site, directly to Miajima port in 40-45 minutes.

Miyajima is beautiful. We luckily had enough time to walk to the Mt Misen gondola for the last trip up the mountain. Quickly enjoyed the views and returned down before closing time. On this trip we also fit in the famous and beautiful Itsukushima Shrine, took pics with the Tori gate in the low tide and quickly looked at the 5 story pagoda. Add in a little shopping and a bit of food, it made for a perfect half day out. A whirlwind for sure but worth the effort!

Highly recommend visiting...would return to enjoy the site with more time.

Oh the deer!!! Quite aggressive especially if food is involved. Witnessed several assaults on unsuspecting tourists for their food. One woman utilized her umbrella to deter it...unsuccessfully!",Tripadvisor
"When in Hiroshima, don’t miss Miyajima Island of which the floating Itsukushima Shrine is only one of its many attractions. The ferry to the island leaves every 15 minutes and the ride is only around 10 minutes. It’s a nice, leisurely walk from the ferry terminal to the shrine assuming the weather is good. I don't think it will be as enjoyable if it’s rainy and wet. The walk is lined with shops and food stalls and we enjoyed very fresh and juicy grilled oysters for which Hiroshima is known for. Another staple is the freshly baked Momiji manju, a sweet pastry shaped like a maple leaf filled with red bean paste, custard, chocolate or cheese. However, look out for the aggressive deers who will go after your food! Because the island is an open space, it does not feel crowded like the other shrines in Japan. I recommend going late in the afternoon when it’s cooler and the day-trippers have gone.",Tripadvisor
"A lovely island, Miyajima welcomes you with lovely views, superb shrines, plenty of spots to relax & click selfies and a relaxing vibe.",Tripadvisor
"We really enjoyed our day on the island. Bests me why anyone would bother messing around with trains when the ferry from the Peace Park is so scenic and convenient - it was part of the fun! The gondola up and the views from Mt Misen were breathtakingly beautiful, and the hike down too but definitely not for anyone not in good physical shape as it’s pretty uneven with some deep level changes. I actually think it would have been easier to hike up (if your fitness is good) than down. We spent 6 hours which was enough to see the shrine, do the above and have lunch and a wander round the very touristy village.",Tripadvisor
I went on a day trip to this island. You will first be greeted by the plethora of docile sika deer. One may visit the Itsukushima Shrine and the “floating” Torii gate. In the morning the gate appears to float in the water. By the afternoon the tide recedes and you may walk right up to the magnificent gate. The island also features the Miyajima Public Aquarium and the Daishoin temple. There are wonderful shops and restaurants where fans of oysters will be especially happy. I also suggest trying a delicious chocolate filled Momiji manjū from one of the many purveyors of these baked treats. No trip to Japan is complete without a visit to this place.,Tripadvisor
"Went there and was a little concerned if there would be enough to do, but ended up running out of time. The deer are charming but they can get a little nippy if you have food, so keep an eye on them if your child has an ice cream or snack. There are plenty of shops and food outlets. The Tori gate is impressive, better for photo's when the tide is in. Well worth a visit.",Tripadvisor
"One of the best place to visit in whole Hiroshima. Miyajima island is super dreamy and like a place of fantasy. The deers 🦌 roaming around freely, the cute shops and the big Toori gate on the beach 🌊 ⛩️
You can just enjoy this place all day and night time view is amazing too.
Super recommend👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻",Tripadvisor
"Beautiful place for a half day visit. Check in advance for when the tides are in/out if you want to get a photo of the Torii gate during high tide. Otherwise it's just surrounded by sand. The Daishon temple is a must visit. Very interesting buildings. Worthwhile getting a tour or reading up in advance. The cable car to the Shishiiwa Observatory is the other must see, Beware the cable cars stop running at 4:30pm so give yourself enough time to get to the top before they close down. It's approximately 20 minutes from the lower station to the top.",Tripadvisor

"Wir sind an einem bewölkten, teils regnerischen Tag nach Miyajima. Daher waren weniger Touristen vor Ort als üblich. Man kann mit JR Pass mit Straßenbahn und Fähre anreisen oder nimmt ohne JR Pass das Speedboot direkt vom Friedenspark.
Bei Regen/Gewitter sollte jedem klar sein, dass die Seilbahn nicht fährt und selbst bis zur Seilbahn ist es kleiner Aufstieg.
Das Torii im Wasser ist schön und kann von allen Seiten gut fotografiert werden. Der Schrein mit dem ""Haupt-Foto-Spot"" vorm Torii ist teuer und überlaufen.
Es gibt schöne Wanderwege und einige kostenfreie Tempel und Schreine zu bestaunen, so z.B. die Temple-Cave.
Essen sollte man lieber günstiger vor und nach dem Ausflug auf dem Festland. Vorsicht bei einem Snack auf einer Parkbank - die Rehe lassen sich von nichts abschrecken.",Tripadvisor
Lieu assez unique qu'on apprécie encore plus en y passant la nuit car les hordes de touristes sont parties le soir... et pas encore revenues le matin.

Het is jammer dat het eiland tot een enorme toeristische attractie verworden is, waardoor de rust die bij een dergelijke omgeving hoort ver te zoeken is.

"What a huge disappointment. It took is more than four hours extra and you can not see the gate at all.

The temple and deer were nice to see,but definitely not worth all the effort.

Tiba di dermaga ambil map sebagai panduan lokasi kunjungan selama di pulau.

Be respectful of the local deer who wander the streets and don't be like one stupid American tourist drop your sweetcorn/maize for them as a) its littering and b) with a pointed skewet it's dangerous for them. Nice green hills as a backdrop. Plenty to see.,Tripadvisor
My son and I took this little excursion while we were visiting in May. When you go at high tide it looks like the Torii Gate is floating. It's beautiful! You can also see oysters growing in the water on the way over. There are some fantastic oyster restaurants on the island.,Tripadvisor
"Really pleased I visited and enjoyed the trip there and back via boat. The trip down the river was nice and gentle and then across the bay an enjoyable high speed ride.

As a shrine it is worth a visit but getting from the dock through to the shrine it is just non stop gift shops and restaurants which I felt devalued to some extent the shrine itself. On the far side of the shrine it was a bit quieter and there were some nice restaurants that were a bit more peaceful.

"Charming island, perfect for a nature stroll. Beautiful fall color, small shops/hotels, lantern-lined streets along the bay, quiet and very picturesque. Just minutes away from Hiroshima. Note: huge Torri gate under restoration until summer 2020, but still worth the visit.",Tripadvisor
"Definitely worth the visit!! We took the train from Tokyo to Hiroshima and then a ferry to the island. However when we were there September 2019 the floating Torii Gate was covered in scaffolding which was very disappointing, but the island in its self is very beautiful. Definitely worth the trip!",Tripadvisor
"電車または、車でいけますが、電車でいくと意外と広島駅からは遠く感じました。
また、厳島神社にいくまでの商店街が非常に人が多いため、歩きづらかった",Tripadvisor
Omg the whole temple in the water thing o-Tori gate is covered in scaffolding and crap. It is clearly under renovation but NOONE tells you! This is very poor form by Japanese people that pride themselves on integrity and transparency. The rest of the island is ruined by tourists and associated traps. They must think we are morons. We got there on a fast river boat which was good even when one of the staff lost a plastic lid whilst feeding seagulls lol.,Tripadvisor
A nice daytrip from Hiroshima. The big otorii gate was under construction when I was there but there was still lots to see!!,Tripadvisor

You can see them everywhere on the island and they are quite friendly to tourists🥰🥰",Tripadvisor

"I highly recommend visiting on a day trip from a Hiroshima, even with the famous Tori gate under repair and the view obscured There is so much to see and do on this enchanted island. With yourJR pass you can catch local train and JR ferry for no extra charge, and there is a very frequent service. The island is so beautiful to walk around, yummy food stores offering oysters and the local cake. Temples to admire, you can easily spend an entire day here",Tripadvisor
I could not get a solid answer on when they expected the construction to be done so there wasn't much to see. Also the Rope Car to the top of the mountain is undergoing maintenance for the month of February,Tripadvisor
"From Hiroshima station we can take a bus to the port and then take the ferry to Miyajima Island. Its a small island where the floating gate existed.
There were also so many restaurant and souvenir shops where yo can buy snacks such as chicken karage, ice cream, and the most special production was the honey.
Sugibee honey sells varieties honey.. yuzu honey and so many more",Tripadvisor

"left our hotel and walked to the ferry dock, buying a sandwich along the way. the dock is at the entrance to the peace memorial park. one buys return tickets for a set time. the ferry was already full at that early in the morning. we didn't think to check with the hotel as to the tides for the tori. comfortable ride, 45 minutes each way. the main reason for coming here was to see the great tori, the largest in japan...and ....it was completely bubble wrapped for repairs....couldn't even guess what it looked like without pics. a major disappointment although that comes part and parcel with travelling we've found. the island is also referred to as itsukushima island. it is mountainous and surrounded by the seto inland sea. it has a population of about 2000 people. i was very surprised how busy it was at the start of our day and the end. there are tame deer, 500 pf them, wandering the streets. watch anything in your hands, we saw one grab a man's map and chomp away at it, they have no fear. we followed the crowds and decided to take the cable car/ropeway up mt. misen. followed the trail. there are 2 parts to it, on at momijidani station to kayatani station. walk a bit and then over a large gorge up to shishiiwa station almost at the summit. great views of the seto inland sea along the way. the peak is at 535 m. i decided we'd walk down, envisioning a gentle sloping trail down through the maples, which were too early in the season for them to have changed colours...another disappointment... well, it took us about 2 hours, steep rock steps the whole way down. not good on hubby's knees...small halls and the eternal flame along the way. not too many people. there are 3 courses down, we took the daishoin trail, to see the daishoin temple. interesting rock dam built along the way. rest stops. signs that said to watch for poisonous vipers. friendly folks passing us saying "" koonichiwa"", helped with the arduousness of the decline. not what we had planned on doing. came to the daishoin temple which had a long climb up to it. all lovely but by then i was tired. lovely singing heard and not seen. a world peace event going on. down into the main street area, bought a couple of beer and peanuts and sipped and nibbled in an open area by the main shrine. found a wonderful micro brewery, miyajima, on the second floor, great view. lovely cheese and cracker appy, friendly staff. by then it was time to catch our 3:30 ferry. made our way through the rickshaws and the deer and the many people still arriving which surprised me, which i suppose shouldn't have as the island is very popular to come to to pray at the many shrines and temples and to enjoy the forests. a very full day with many sights to see.",Tripadvisor
"Wir sind vom Hiroshima Peace Park mit dem Boot nach Miyajima gefahren, ca. 40min.
Miyajima war für mich ein Highlight! Wunderschön während der Kirschblütenzeit!
Das Dorf ist auch sehr schön. Wir waren kurz auf dem Mt Misen und sind dann nach unten gelaufen. Für Naturliebhaber sehr sehr schön!
Die Rehe sind natürlich auch lustig. Und ja, es hat sehr viele Besucher und es wird im Dorf echt eng, aber sobald man etwas mehr abseits spaziert hats weniger Menschen und wunderschöne Ecken!",Tripadvisor
"Secondo me è un tappa fondamentale per un viaggio in Giappone.
Quando siamo andati noi il famoso torii rosso era in ristrutturazione, nonostante questo l'isola è comunque stupenda e ne vale davvero la pena, basta camminare e lasciarsi trasportare nelle varie vie.",Tripadvisor
"When you visit Hiroshima, you will definetly visit Miyajima.

I came here to see the floating shrine but I later found out the highlight was the ropeway to the island top.

You will marvel at the view you see there.

The blue sky, the clouds, the island, the see. Everything was just so beautiful that it surpassed my imagination.

It made my trip to Japan totally worth it!

Not sure if I will go back again but it is a memeroy that will last a lifetime.

広島が誇る世界遺産の島として、どなたでもご存知の宮島だと思いますが、島内観光という意味では、意外と観光地として注目されているエリアは狭くて、しかも見所が凝縮しているので、軽い気持ちで訪問してしまうと、必ず見逃しスポットが生じてしまう濃厚な観光地だと思います。是非、事前にマップなどをよくご確認の上、ご自身の興味に合わせて訪問スポットを絞り込んで、無駄のない順路での散策をお勧め致します。,Tripadvisor
"We had a lovely day here with lots of things to do and see. We went in the Itsukishima Shrine which was beautiful with lovely views across the water. There are lots of lovely shops to go in which had many reasonably priced goods. Wandering around was good too, the cherry blossom was gorgeous and the Sika deer walking around freely are so cute. You can also walk out to the torii gate on the sand, obviously when the tide is out! And make sure you try the local beer.",Tripadvisor
"The primary reason to visit was to see Itsukushima Shrine. It was a nice walk which included many deer who roam the area and will follow you for food an will also eat paper from your hands!

"From Hiroshima, take a tram or a train to Miyajima-guchi pier. From there, take the JR ferry (there is another ferry run by a private operator). The advantages of taking the JR ferry are that it is free is you have a JR rail pass and they take you through the Great Tori gate during high tide. See attached picture with timings of o- tori ferry rides. During low tide, you can walk up to the Tori gate which is a great spot for pictures. Visit the Itsukushima shrine which is on the sea shore, the Daiganji temple and the five storied pagoda. You can either hike or take a cable car ride to Mount Misen. The cable car ride closes by 5 pm. A free mini bus ride is available uphill to the cable car point in case you don't feel like walking. There are a number of restaurants, food stalls and souvenir shops on the island. During the evening when the lights come on, the Itsukushima shrine and the Tori gate are a sight to behold. There are hotels on the island for an overnights stay.",Tripadvisor

Они были настолько опутаны сеткой и лесами, что внутри только смутно угадывался их силуэт, и то, только потому что ранее, видела их на фотографии:(
Зато мы попробовали вкуснейшие устрицы на гриле, жареную кукурузу, которую ту же отбирали попрошайки-олени :) От оленей там действительно спасу нет, только отвернешься, а они уже жуют картофель-фри из твоего стаканчика, и запивают твоей же колой!

"We took a day and visited Miyajima Island while staying in Hiroshima and it was my favorite part of Japan. From the boat ride to the little town to the shrine and Great Torii, it was such a relaxing and beautiful island. If you buy the Japan Rail Pass the boat ride to the island is included in that pass. Once on the island the walk to the Great Torii passes by quaint little shops and food vendors. Plan your visit so that you can see the Great Torii while the tide is in and while it is out. When the tide is out you can walk right up to the Torii. There are many deer on the island but you are not to feed or interact with them (which is very different from Nara).",Tripadvisor
A must visit if you are around the Hiroshima area. Place is clean and very beautiful. Deer roam freely and you can pet and take photos with them. Itsukushima Shrine is also on the island which is a famous landmark. I spent around 3 hours there.,Tripadvisor

"We came to Miyajima from Fukuoka on the Shinkansen to Hiroshima. Since Miyajima is an island, it required a 10 minute ferry ride to reach. Once you are there, we visited the Itsukushima Shrine and Daishoin Temple. There are lots of deer wandering around on the island. And you MUST try the oysters. We ate at Yakigaki No Hayashi (separate review) and it was amazing.

So even though we were disappointed the Torii Gate was under renovation and covered in scaffolding, we still had a great time. I would have liked to have spent the whole day in Miyajima but we allocated the second half of our day to Hiroshima.",Tripadvisor

"This is about 40 mins trip from Hiroshima. You can take the JR (Sanyo) from Hiroshima to Miyajimaguchiko station and then take the ferry (2 mins walk from the station) to the island. We spent a half day on this island.

Unfortunately for us the O-torii gate is currently under construction for repairs, so all you see is the scaffolding boards around. Missed opportunity.

But the island itself is beautiful. There are semi-wild deers around the shrine (skipped Nara for this reason) and a number of shrines on the island to visit. The one you must visit is the Itsukushima Shrine (the main one you see upon arrive on the ferry). It costs 300 yen for adults entry fee. The shrine is beautiful, the red design is very captivating. If you happened to be there during a low tide, you can walk along the wet sand in front of the shrine. It really is quite magical.

The aquarium at Miyajima is also an attraction. Audiences are up close to the sea lion show and you have a chance to pat a penguin.

The ropeway leads up to the Mt Misen where there are beautiful sceneries of forests and different shrines/temples to see.",Tripadvisor

"We specifically went to the island to see the world-famous red o-torii gate, but there is so much else to see and do.

There are many deer roaming the streets, and signs to warn you they will try to eat food or paper that you have.

We walked from the ferry terminal to the Itsukushima Shrine from where you can see the o-torii gate. There are plenty of places to walk on the island or catch a cable car to enjoy the views from higher up.

There are plenty of monuments, a very large concrete torii gate
Stunning place to visit - definitely a must see on a trip to Japan.

My favourite view of the famous o-torii gate is from the side as you see all the pillars. The view from the shrine is a straight on view.

It will be lovely to revisit and stay a few days, rather than just a day trip.",Tripadvisor
"昔から行ってみたかったので友人と行ってきました！
豊かな自然に囲まれて素敵な場所なんだろうなぁと思っていましたが、そこには飢えた鹿たちがたくさんいました…
行政が餌やりを禁止したとのこと。
完全に餌付けで育ってきた子たちがいきなり餌やりを禁止され、路上のゴミを食べ漁る姿。
何とも複雑な気持ちになりました。
また、死んだ赤ちゃんと子宮が出てきてしまって瀕死状態の鹿もいました。
奈良県ではちゃんと怪我や病気をした鹿を保護する団体があるのですが、こちらにはないようです…
昔から有名な観光名所なだけに、ショックが大きかったです。
行政は野生だから何もしないの一点張りですが、鹿せんべいを売ることや餌やりを黙認していたわけなので、もはや鹿たちは野生ではないですよね…

Be advised, however, that under such conditions do NOT expect to be alone on the island, so come prepared!!!

"Mit der JR Bahn von Hiroschima aus nach Miyajima dauert keine Stunde. Bereits auf der JR Fährte konnte man den Torii bewundern. Die Insel wird mir immer in Erinnerung bleiben.

"I had always wanted to return to Miyajima, Itsukushima and the Torii Gate in the water after visiting in a very sultry July 35 years ago.

The place did not disappoint, although there are many more visitors these days. We managed to visit close to high tide. A highlight was a trip out to and through the gate on a traditional rowing boat complete with straw hats and capes. Very atmospheric and restored much of the sense of peace that had been a little shaken in the crowds to get out there.

The walk through Itsukushima Shrine, ""floating"" on the water was enchanting. Take time to explore the little short paths off the main tourist route and the ancient Noh stage.

Another highlight was lunch in a restaurant beyond Itukushima Shrine, looking back on the Torii Gate.

If we came again, we'd look to stay overnight on the island and have it much more to ourselves than during the day.

One of Japan's three traditional great scenic spots, this island continues to enchant.",Tripadvisor
"「宮島訪問税」が課金されるようになってから初めの訪問でした。宮島口からフェリーで僅か10分の対岸とあって多くの観光客が訪れていました。大半の観光客の向かう先は厳島神社とあって参道商店街は混雑しており、休日のランチタイムは食事を摂るにも大変な状態になっていました。　
又、餌やり禁止の鹿たちは人間を追い掛け回す事が無く、おとなしい印象を受けました。

"eccellenti strutture per storia ed architettura. iconico il torii nell'acqua, da vedere sia con la bassa che con l'alta marea. un giorno di visita può bastare. da provare le ostriche fritte. gusto particolare",Tripadvisor
"After being unable to visit Japan since December of 2019 due to COVID, it was such a pleasure to return and to return to one of our favorite places, Miyajima.

We were very touched that merchants, restaurateurs, and hoteliers, whom we have dealt with for years, remembered us and greeted us so very warmly.

After three and a half years, the completion of the renovation of Itsukushima Shrine’s Torii was notable: the repainted vermilion pillars were stunning in the blazing sun; the less visible structural renovations should help the torii to stay standing for many years to come.

Even though it can be very touristy, the island is much like a small rural town with none of the hustle and bustle of the big cities, which also means there isn’t much of a night life. For us, this is a positive break in the midst of the cities visited during any trip. We enjoy the quiet of the evenings, after the day-trippers have left.

There is always plenty to do and see whether it’s visiting our favorite temple, Daisho-in, or climbing Mt Misen, or photographing the people and places on the island. There is always at least one bride and groom having a photo shoot at an overlook or bridge, a deer stealing a map from an unsuspecting tourist’s pocket, a butterfly balancing on a flower, sakura in a profusion of pink or momiji in red.

Visitor’s Tips:
There are no trash barrels, be prepared to pocket any trash.
The newly constructed Tourist Information Center has welcome toilets (and trash barrels). Be sure to notice the changing light show on the walls. You can pick up maps and brochures here in addition to what you can get at the small kiosk at the ferry terminal.",Tripadvisor
"Floating temple & Tori gate (although both were dry on our visit), wonderful walks and buildings, and a bustling tourist street for mementoes and refreshments. Very busy with people - and deer - and just the most wonderful place. The short ferry ride across was a treat too as the mist-shrouded mountains slowly edged into view and then... you saw the gate! Superb.",Tripadvisor
We had a magical visit to Miyajima on a day trip from Hiroshima. When we arrived it was very busy with tourists so we hiked up mount Misen which was much quieter and had spectacular views. When we descended it was sunset. The last tourist boat leaves at 5pm but there are local ferries which leave much later so we were able to enjoy the sunset views peacefully with only a few people around. It is well worth waiting for the sunset.,Tripadvisor
"Esta isla se llega mediante un ferry, que esta incluido en el JR Pass. Lo mejor es subir en el teleférico, para apreciar las vistas de las islas y el mar, creo que el templo co el torri en el mar esta sobrevalorado. Una recomendación, casi todos los negocios de esta isla solo aceptan efectivo, y no hay forma de cambiar dólares a yenes o utilizar la tarjeta de credito",Tripadvisor
"Pequena e linda ilha situada a menos de 1 hora da cidade de Hiroshima, partindo da estação Hiroshima, linha Sanyo, até a Estação Miyajimaguchi. Para chegar a ilha, caminhada curta até a estação das balsas, com a viagem durando cerca de 10 minutos. Famosa pelo gigante Torii, patrimônio da humanidade da Unesco, que na maré alta parece flutuar. Ideal passar um dia inteiro, se possível pernoitar para aproveitar melhor o santuário de Itsukushima, templo Daisho-in, caminhar pelas trilhas para o monte Missen, passear pela cidade e ver os cervos perambulando livremente( não podem ser alimentados, diferente de Nara), … enfim, há muito mais para ver e fazer, pois não faltam atrativos. Adoramos a visita!",Tripadvisor

ＪＲフェリー6時25分発にて宮島到着です。この時間帯なら多くの観光客が訪れる厳島神社も私一人で独占です。他の寺社仏閣でも誰に気兼ねなく写真撮り放題でした。もちろんお店が開いていることは無いのですが・・。母鹿に甘える子鹿の姿にもホッとさせてくれます。残念なことは赤い鳥居が工事中だったこと、それでも十分堪能できました。,Tripadvisor
"日本の広島県廿日市市宮島町にある島。JRまたは広電の宮島口駅から、フェリーで渡れる。
瀬戸内海西部、広島湾の北西部に位置する。古代より、島そのものが自然崇拝の対象であったと考えられる。
平安時代末期以降は、厳島神社の影響力の強さや海上交通の拠点としての重要性から、たびたび歴史の表舞台に登場するようになった。江戸時代中期には、天橋立、松島と並ぶ、日本三景の一つに挙げられる景勝地として広く知られることにもなり、日本屈指の参詣地・観光地として栄えるようになった。
人口僅か1800人余りの島に世界中から、参拝客及び観光客が訪れる。正直、オーバーツーリズム。
景勝地としての厳島の中心は、厳島神社である。島の最高峰は弥山（標高535メートル）で巨石が立ち並び、信仰の対象となってきた。弥山にはロープウェイもあり、一度は登山すべき山です。
1952年（昭和27年）には国の特別史跡及び特別名勝に指定され、弥山の原始林は国の天然記念物に指定されている。
弥山は弘法大師が100日間の修行をしたという「弥山本堂」や“消えずの火”が1200年以上も燃え続けている「霊火堂」があり、パワースポットでもある。
不動明王が安置された「不動岩」が、左側に巨大な岩のアーチ「くぐり岩」がある",Tripadvisor
"ここは、大阪からは非常にとおかったです、往復７００キロぐらいあるかな笑

それをポルシェでいってきましたよ、　僕のポルシェは、サーキット用なのでめっちゃしんどかったです泪

さて、宮島いきの船の前にパーキングがたくさんあるのでそこに止めて、フェーリーにのって１５分ぐらいだったかな　で、宮島に到着です。

島につくとすでに鳥居がみえてて、そこから神社までお土産屋さんがたくさんあるとうりをするすると歩いていきますと　お～～　　神の聖域　厳島神社がみえます。

時間によっては、干潮で鳥居の下までいけますよ＾＾。　僕らはいけました笑

で、お参りさせて頂き、アナゴを食べてかえりました。　　

ここは、なんかいいですね～～",Tripadvisor
"広島本土からフェリー15分ほどで到着しました。
2021年6月下旬時点で厳島神社の大鳥居は工事中でした。厳島神社の前半は柱がクリアな赤色(朱色)で美しいですが後半は古い赤色のままでした。
鹿の数はのべ5頭でした。思ったより少なかったです。
商店街のお店は半分くらい閉まっていました。でもスイーツ、ジュースなど美味しかったです。
厳島神社近辺だけを立ち寄られる方はトータル往復3時間ほどを想定すると良いと思います。広島側の駐車場は、1日500円〜1,500円とピンキリなので半径200メートルほどの狭い範囲を回って探されてはと思います。",Tripadvisor
修復中の大鳥居を見るのも、この時期にしかできない体験です。今でも遊覧の櫓船が運行されていますが利用者も少ないようです。,Tripadvisor
"7月下旬の水曜日に観光しました。
各名所は個別にレポートするとして、今回は愛煙家の皆さま向けの情報を。
愛煙家にとって肩身の狭い昨今、ここ宮島においても同様でございます。
旅行計画を立て、事前に名所や飲食店を調べるにあたり、喫煙所の所在や、喫煙可or店外に喫煙所設置の有無等々、「どこで煙草休憩できるのか？」をチェックしておくのがマストになっています。
少数派であると思いますが、そのような愛煙家の方もおられるかと思い、宮島にて煙草休憩できるポイントをお教えします。
①宮島桟橋喫煙所
・宮島桟橋を出て正面ロータリー左側すぐのところにあります。
　ベンチ・机も有り、木陰になっていて、夏場は涼めて助かります。
　私は、途中、何回もここまで戻って煙草休憩しました。
②紅葉堂弐番屋
・揚げもみじで有名な「紅葉堂」さんの支店です。表参道商店街にあります。
　店内で名物・揚げもみじをイートインできるのですが、冷暖房完備のお部屋の奥　　　　
　に串神社があって、食べ終わった串を奉納できるようになってまして、神社の横　
　は喫煙席になっています。無料でお茶のサービスも有ります。
　名物の美味しい揚げもみじもいただけて、お茶もいただけて、愛煙家にとっては
　天国のようなお店でした(笑)",Tripadvisor

"今は鳥居は改修工事中で見れないけど、その代わりに鳥居の真ん中にあるのが下に下ろされて間近で見れるのである意味貴重な物が見れます！
そして今の時期はとくに紅葉が綺麗なのでライトアップに合わせて夜の宮島を散策するのもまた違った味わいがありいいですよ！",Tripadvisor
"中学生以来の宮島でしたが、大人になって訪れると感じる事も変わり、新鮮でした。
フェリーに乗るのが楽しくて、宮島に近づくにつれテンションも上がります。

今はやはりインスタ映えだったり、おしゃれなお店が増えているなと感じました。
昔はもっとがやがやと、昔ながらのお土産通りといった印象が強かった気がします。
残念ながら鳥居は工事中で見ることはできませんでした。

お目当てのもみじまんじゅうは、昔はものすごくたくさんの味の種類があって選びきれない！といった記憶があったんですが、今は厳選されているような気がしました。
それでも食べたことのない味もあったし、「あげもみじ」という新しいジャンルの食べ歩きも増えていました。
味は…強いて言うならサーターアンダギーのような、ホットケーキみたいな感じです。

他にもおしゃれな珈琲屋さんにも行きました。
コーヒーのソフトクリームがめちゃくちゃ美味しかったです。

歩いて食べて、まったりと楽しみました。
そういえば鹿はあまり見ませんでした。",Tripadvisor
宮島口からのフェリーはピストン輸送なので乗り場が少々並んでいても大丈夫です。厳島神社は工事中です。七五三の参拝客が何組もいらっしゃいました。ちょっと奥に行くと紅葉がきれいです。,Tripadvisor
"2021年11月10日は、午後から少し時期が早い気がしたものの、色づき始めた宮島の紅葉谷のライトアップに出掛けました。まず、フェリー乗り場で、船から降りて来る修学旅行生の集団に驚きます。緊急事態宣言が解除されて一気に緩和された旅行の実態を垣間見た感覚を覚えました。宮島に到着して最初に目を引いたのは、現在、修理中である海の中にある大鳥居の足場にセットされてあった幌が撤去されてスケルトンになっていた事でした。その後、宮島三つ星ホテル「岩惣」の直近から紅葉谷に入った私達でしたが、ライトアップ用の照明をセットされていた場所が、割と狭小エリアだった事に驚きます。

一応、近くにあった閉店準備中のお店の人に「ライトアップのエリアは何処からどこまでですか？」と尋ねたところ、「そこのエリアだけですよ」と言う、えっ？！？と言う答えが返って来たのでした。その狭小エリアのみのライトアップで「宮島紅葉谷のライトアップ」と銘打つ、恥ずかしい程の強心臓さに驚くと共に、逆を考えたら広大な紅葉谷は危険な箇所も多く、圧倒的な暗さの前では仕方ないのかな？とも考えましたね。そのライトアップはまだ暗くならない内から開始されました。一頻り、しつこい程に撮影を敢行した私達でしたが、直ぐにお腹いっぱい状態になりました。流石にその時間では通りを歩く人も疎でしたが、修理中の大鳥居が軽くライトアップされていたのが良かったですね。",Tripadvisor
"宮島口からフェリーですぐに行ける島です。
日本三景の一つでもあり、観光客もたくさんいて常に混んでいるイメージです。
お土産屋さんや飲食店は常に混んでいますがブラブラ歩くだけでも楽しいです。
島内に泊まって早朝散歩すると気持ちよさそうです。",Tripadvisor
"島には住民もいるとはいえ、全域に宗教ぽい雰囲気が漂う。
日本で、こういう地域は珍しい。

私が行ったのは、１月末の夕方。
その為、綺麗な残照が見れた。
ここは、建物だけでなく自然も魅力。

厳島神社だけ参拝したい人なら、１時間で十分。

今回は日程の都合で2時間ほどの滞在時間しか取れませんでした。嚴島神社、大願寺、千畳閣などを観光し、表参道の商店街でお土産を物色したら、あっという間に出発の時間になりました。時間があれば弥山やもみじ谷、大聖院にも行きたかったですね。,Tripadvisor
大きな木製のしゃもじ。人気の少ない高台にあります。五重塔もよく見えるところにありますので、散策にぜひ。,Tripadvisor
"Shrine is a highlight.
Place is promoted as a place of solitude. When we went there it was TEEMING with school kids, not so quiet.
Floating torii gate was impressive",Tripadvisor
Even though it was a wet and rainy day the island is still worth visiting even though it is now pretty much a tourist trap. Great to walk around and see the temple and tori gate.,Tripadvisor
"Could not recommend more highly!
You have to visit Miyajima if you are in Hiroshima.
Lovely views from the ferry, get off to be greater by a Tori gate, floating shrine and deer roaming the streets. You can go walking, on the cable cars or enjoy the street food.
Was possibly the best day of our 2 week trip to Japan! We thought we were going to stay an hour or two and we almost missed seeing Hiroshima we were there that long! Utterly beautiful place! Must see!",Tripadvisor
Credo sia uno dei posti che più rappresenta il Giappone. Ad ogni passo una nuova prospettiva e una nuova foto da portare a casa.,Tripadvisor
If you are in Kyoto you should not skip a visit here. There is nowhere else like it and is truly iconic. I would recommend going early to avoid crowds. We didn't go all the way to the top as we were short on time but I would like to go back and go all the way up!,Tripadvisor

"　宿から5分で厳島神社に着くので、荷物を旅館に預けたまま探訪するとよい。
大鳥居は生憎改装工事中に着き、白いシートですっぽり覆われていた。

　回廊から海を覗くと、丸い輪っかの模様がかわいいフグの赤ちゃんたちが一杯泳いでいた。",Tripadvisor
厳島神社の入口に満潮時間と干潮時間が書いてあり、これを頼りに両方の景色を楽しみました。満潮の時は、水が神殿の床ぎりぎりまでくるので、水の上に浮いているような神秘的な光景でした。逆に干潮の時は、鳥居まで歩いていくことができ、全く違う景色でした。,Tripadvisor
厳島神社に初めて行ってきました。残念ながら大鳥居は修復作業中で見ることはできませんでした。中に入って廊下から見る五重塔などの景色は壮観な眺めでした。とても趣のある建物で、後ろの山に靄がかかっていたので、一段と厳かな雰囲気になっていました。干潮になりだしたところだったので、帰り際に海を見ると海に降りる階段の下は砂浜が現れていました。,Tripadvisor
厳島神社は、海に面した場所にあるので、潮の満ち引きでその印象も変わってきます。出来れば、満潮の時間に訪れた方が、海に浮かぶ神社の景色が見れるので、良いと思いました。神社全体が朱色で装飾され、とても厳かな雰囲気です。午前中の方が比較的空いていて、ゆっくりと参拝する事が出来ました。本殿をつなぐ回廊には結構隙間が空いているので、物を落とさないように注意が必要です。,Tripadvisor

平清盛によって建立された厳島神社は海にそびえる壮大な神社で、現在世界遺産に登録されています。潮の満ち引きによって見せる二つの魅力がある珍しい神社です。干潮時には大鳥居まで歩いて行けましたが、残念ながら私達が訪れた時は大掛かりな工事中で、大鳥居をすっぽりとシートで覆い足場が組まれていました。満潮時はまるで海に浮かぶ神殿です。昔の人達はどのようにしてこの神殿や大鳥居を作ったのでしょうか？ しかし現在、この神社は神社本庁別表の神社ですから賽銭は入れませんでした。日本会議の資金にされたくないので。,Tripadvisor
"名前の通り厳かな神社、入口から出口まで赤塗りで横にこんなに長い神社もないんじゃないですかね。
真ん中に神社の入口があって、行って帰ってくると言うのが私の今までの神社ですが、ここは端から端へ抜ける横長な神社でした。
朝は潮が引いてて夜とは違う顔を見せてくれました。",Tripadvisor

前回は真夏のあまりの暑さに駆け足の観光でしたが、今回はさほど暑くもなくゆっくりと廻れました。

"本殿や鳥居に目を引かれ見逃しがちですが、海上に張り出した平舞台もまた見所。

平清盛が久安2年（1146）安芸守に任官され、平家の守護神として尊崇し、平家一門の権力が増大するにつれてこの社を尊崇する度合いも増し、社殿を現在の姿に造営しました。都から後白河上皇、建春門院、中宮徳子、高倉上皇、建礼門院を始めとする皇族や貴族が訪れたので、都の文化や建築が宮島に入ってきました。現在も嚴島神社に伝承されている舞楽は、清盛公によって大阪四天王寺から移されたものです。社殿は、災害により何度か立て替えられていますが、清盛公が造営した当時の姿を伝えられているといわれています。,Tripadvisor

神社では、たまたま神殿式の結婚式を執り行っており、ちょっと感動しました。
などなど色々見る所、イベントたくさんあります。
一つ思ったのが意外と広島市内から距離がある事です。片道一時間弱は考えておいた方が良いです。
後、こんな言い方誤解されるかもしれませんが外国人の方々を全くと言っていいほど拝見いたしませんでした。
心地よく観光をするなら今がチャンスだと思います。

15時過ぎに宮島口フェリーに乗って到着しました。参道前のお店はそろそろ店じまいを始める時間帯で寂しい思いをしました。神社は美しく又訪れたくなる所ですが、お天気も雨模様でしかも夕方の訪問だったので、観光客も数える程しかいらっしゃいませんでした。にぎやかでお天気の良い日にもう一度訪れたいスポットです。,Tripadvisor

部分的に工事中ですが神社の参拝には問題ありません。ただ、大鳥居が工事中で見れないのが残念です。やはり満潮時の方が厳島神社らしくていいですね。,Tripadvisor
My son and I came to the island with out tour guide. He made sure we were coming here during high tide so the torii gate appeared to be floating. He also made sure we were on the correct side of the ferry to get the full effect after going around the curve. While we were on the island he took us to a shrine on a hilltop. Along the steps getting there were little buddhas with colorful knit caps. Such a beautiful island!,Tripadvisor

いつでも行ける地域に住んでいながら、逆に行く機会が殆んどない「宮島厳島神社」に孫の七五三と言うタイミングで行って来ました。前回、訪れたのは、その孫が生まれて３ヶ月目に宮詣りとして訪れた時でしたね。正に5年振りに行く宮島は、外国人観光客の坩堝と化していました。土日を避けて敢えて金曜日に行ったにも関わらず、恐ろしい人の群れと遭遇。長男一家が全員が和装だった事もあり、外国人観光客のリクエストが殺到して、なかなか進む事が叶いませんでした。お参りが済んで、近場の蕎麦屋で昼食を摂りました。そこからの帰り道には往路で寄らなかった土産物街を通り、揚げもみじを始めとした軽いメニューで小腹を膨らませて船着き場に到着した次第です。,Tripadvisor

"Jeg har heldigvis besøgt Miyajima tidligere, og det er et meget smukt sted, men denne gang var hovedattraktionen - den store Torii port i vandet ud for Itsukushima helligdommen - dækket fuldstændigt over med en meget stor presenning!!!
Ikke overraskende var der mange af de besøgende gæster, som blev svært skuffede, da de opdagede det ved ankomsten til øen.
Der var tilsyneladende ikke udsendt info herom, og på færgerne til Miyajima blev passagererne stadig gjort opmærksomme på at holde udkig efter den store port, som de altså slet ikke kunne se...
Vejret var ellers perfekt til det ‘klassiske’ foto af porten ude i vandet i den nedgående sol, bortset altså fra den manglende hovedattraktion.
Til gengæld faldt der lidt mere ‘ro’ på alle de mange besøgende, så de kunne nå at se alle de mange andre seværdigheder på Miyajima i stedet for at holde pladser på kajen i timevis inden solnedgang som ved mine tidligere besøg.",Tripadvisor

Rientriamo giusto ora 3 dicembre 2019 da una visita ad Hiroshima con annessa visita all’isola di Miyajima ed al santuario di Itsukushima dal quale si ha una vista mozzafiato verso il Torii più famoso del Giappone . Tutto fantastico ed anche l’isola merita una visita peccato però che il Torii sia al momento attuale sotto restauri per cui interamente coperto da una impalcatura e questa informazione non viene data nemmeno presso l’ufficio informazioni turistiche di Hiroshima . Buona visita,Tripadvisor
This was one of the best shrines I have seen. It’s worth a visit. We went during low tide so we couldn’t see it when water covers it (they say it looks like it’s floating) but it was nice to see it this way too,Tripadvisor
フェリーを下りると可愛い鹿さんが出迎えてくれます。親子鹿が寄り添って毛繕いする様子に癒されます。人の流れに沿って進むと大鳥居が見えるはず、だったのですが、なんと修復中でベールを纏っていて何も見えず残念。丁度干潮で直ぐそばまで歩いて行けました。神社は凛とした空気の中にあり、気持ちが引き締まります。次は満潮の時に来てみたいと思います。,Tripadvisor

"世界遺産を見に厳島神社へ行ってきました。
宮島口よりフェリーに乗って宮島へ渡りました。
車で行くより宮島口近辺の駐車所へ車を置いて人だけで渡った方が良いという話も聞いていたので、宮島口で駐車場を探しましたがどこもいっぱいでなかなか空きがありませんでした。
やっと見つけた所は終日2000円と言う所。
ほんの数時間なんだけど、とも思いましたがしょうがなくそこへ止めました。
物凄い数の観光客です。
フェリーで渡ってる途中、大鳥居を探してたのですがなかなか見つからず。
船内放送で大鳥居は現在改修中と放送があり、島に近づくにつれ白い大きなものが海上にあるのに気が付きました。
大鳥居は白いシートに覆われ全く見えませんでした。
残念。
これを楽しみにしてたのですが。
上陸してからはぼちぼち歩いて散策。
テレビや雑誌でよく見る風景そのままで、あちこちに鹿が放し飼いされ（野生？）観光客に食べ物をねだっていました。
食べ物を持ちながら歩く方は要注意ですね。
社の中も歩きましたが、御朱印を書いてもらうところは長蛇の列でした。
欲しい方は早い時間に行った方がよさそうです。
全体的にとてもきれいで、今後もこのままずっと変わりなくあってほしいと思う所。

修学旅行の後も1度訪れたことがありましたが、約10年ぶりに伺いました。残念ながら大鳥居は改修中で、完了時期も未定とのこと。それでも朱色の本殿が海に浮いているように見える姿は、やはり美しいです。干潮時と満潮時、それぞれ違った雰囲気です。夜のライトアップはまた幻想的で、時間に余裕がある人は行ってみる価値があると思います。,Tripadvisor
"Il tempio si trova a poche decine di minuti di battello per raggiungere l’isola. Suggestivo il tori in acqua (anche se attualmente si trova ingabbiato dalle impalcature) e bellissimo il percorso all'interno del tempio scintoista.

"We went in February 2020. Both the rope car and the shrine were under renovation. Fortunately, I had a rail pass so we didn't pay extra to get there, but the ferry had no indication that the 2 top attractions on the island were closed. We did see some deer on the island, but it was a long trip to not see the shrine",Tripadvisor
"The short but very busy ferry ride takes you to the island of Itsukushima. From the terminal it is an easy walk along the shore past shops, food stalls and restaurants with numerous other visitors and deer who are not the slightest bit timid. Best to see that shrine at high tide. Be prepared to take numerous photos as each time you have taken one, there is an even better vantage a bit further on.",Tripadvisor
世界遺産、厳島神社発訪問でしたが、事前にわかっていたものの、シンボルの大鳥居が改修工事中のため、やはり魅力半減と行ったところです。神社そのものは素晴らしく、また参道も賑やかで旅行気分は味わえました。但し、ツアー旅行のため時間制限があり、弥山までは行けずに残念でした。次回、大鳥居の工事が終了後に再訪問したいと思います。,Tripadvisor

大鳥居が海に映っている姿が美しかった。干潮の時は間近まで歩いて行けて、その時々の魅力を感じました。改修工事が昨年終わったようで、朱色が鮮やかでした！,Tripadvisor
林立する朱色の柱が美しいです。土足で進める木の床の下には、古くからの木の床板があるそうです。高舞台からは海を背景に大鳥居が正面に見えます。近寄れませんが古色蒼然とした立派な能舞台も素晴らしく、引き潮の時に現れる鏡池はなるほど手鏡の形をしていました。,Tripadvisor
"If you are in Hiroshima, then you must visit this Shinto shrine built in 593. Riding on the ferry and interacting with Japanese children on school field trips provided a wonderful cultural experience. At high tide the shrine appears to be floating in the water. It's considered one of the top 3 scenic sites in Japan. There was a a lovely beach and lots of shops and places to get food. Tamed deer wandered throughout the complex. The main drawback was the massive crowds. If you have time, then use the cable car for even better views.",Tripadvisor
"何度も参拝していますが、今回は前回工事中だった海上にそびえる朱塗りの鳥居が、

"L'Isola di Itsukushima, conosciuta anche come Miyajima, è una delle principali attrazioni turistiche del Giappone. Situata nella baia di Hiroshima, è famosa per il suo iconico Torii galleggiante, che sembra emergere dall'acqua durante l'alta marea. Questo Torii, che appartiene al Santuario di Itsukushima, è considerato uno dei Tre Grandi Torii del Giappone ed è un simbolo importante della spiritualità e della cultura giapponese.

Oltre al Torii, l'isola di Itsukushima è rinomata per il suo bel paesaggio naturale, che include montagne, boschi e spiagge. I visitatori possono godere di passeggiate panoramiche, escursioni e visite ai numerosi templi e santuari dispersi sull'isola. Uno dei luoghi più famosi è il Santuario di Itsukushima, un complesso di edifici sacri costruiti sopra l'acqua.

Miyajima è anche nota per la sua fauna, in particolare i cervi sika che vagano liberamente per l'isola e sono considerati messaggeri degli dei nel culto shintoista. L'isola offre anche una varietà di delizie culinarie, tra cui il popolare anago-meshi (riso con anguilla) e momiji manju (dolcetti a forma di foglia d'acero).

Complessivamente, l'Isola di Itsukushima è un luogo affascinante che offre una combinazione unica di bellezza naturale, spiritualità e storia, attirando visitatori da tutto il mondo.",Tripadvisor
"This is a must as it’s so iconic. The Tori gate is spectacular and there are some beautiful parts of the shrine. It is busy which is to be expected, but people are mostly respectful of queues and are quiet. You can get great views of the gate without entering the shrine if that’s all you want to do, but it’s a very small fee and feels wrong not to go in.",Tripadvisor
"We went early arriving at the shrine by 8:30am. It is a beautiful Shinto Shrine dating back to 1168. We were surrounded by deer and sat for a time watching out over the water, it was very peaceful. Go early to avoid the crowds",Tripadvisor
"The Itsukushima Shrine is hugely popular with visitors, in part because of the unique feature of being built in a way that allows for the tides to flow in and around the temple. The huge torii gate is an iconic element of the shrine. The buildings within the shrine's grounds are note particularly noteworthy, but the design in creative. A visit to the island is all the more appealing by the well-maintained park and neat shopping street.",Tripadvisor
"This shrine is beautiful with its iconic floating Tori gate in the ocean and the shrine appearing to float on water when there is a high tide and the water comes in beneath the buildings and into the surrounding area. It is visually stunning and we were blessed with blue skies and bright sunshine which made the views even more spectacular.

Outside the shrine there is a labyrinth of shopping streets and small restaurants and it inevitably attracts hordes of tourists and day trippers. There appear to be occasional boat trips around the bay passing through the Tori gate too which did not feel appropriate at all.

I only hope that at some stage the numbers visiting will be controlled so as not to spoil what is truly a wonderfully spiritual place. Please protect it from the Instagram crowds. My favourite visit of the whole tour.",Tripadvisor
久しぶりに厳島神社に行きました。歴史を簡易いられる素晴らしい場所です。海に面して建てられている神社で、自然との一体感がありよいと思います。厳島神社の朱色も素晴らしいと思います。中も広くて、とても良いです。この日は能も開催されており、大変良かったです。素晴らしいなと思いました。訪れたときは干潮の時で、海も歩けました。厳島神社を堪能できて良かったです。,Tripadvisor
"The Itsukushima Shrine is a Sinto Shrine on the Miyajima island, famous for its Torii gate. It's one of the most scenic spots in Japan. The Shrine was supposed to be built in the year 593 to the deity who protects from maritime disaster and war. It was rebuilt in 1168 by the warlord Taira no Kiyomori .
The Shrine is famous for its seemingly floating Torii gate during high tide. The gate stands on water and during low tide one can go near the gate. It's one of the most photographed tourist spots. There are many small stone statues along the coast which are quite interesting. Be careful about the deer roaming around. They not only snatch food, also eat paper.
The visit to the Shrine is part of the tour packages for people who visit Miyajima island from Hiroshima. Loved the place, but if you visit as a package tour get very limited time to spend at the Shrine.",Tripadvisor
Enjoyed viewing the Itsukishima Shrine and taking lots of photos. It became a UNESCO World Heritage site in December 1996. The contrast of the shrine against the sea and the hills is beautiful. The patrons line up one at a time on the platform in front of the museum and quickly take their photos and move out. It was nice to see a calm and friendly crowd taking care of each other.,Tripadvisor
"This shrine is the major reason why I decided to visit the Miyajima Island despite the heavy rain. As I walked towards it, I took its pictures from various angles. Closer, it looks much better. Waited for the other visitors to leave so I could have a better, closer photo of thos attraction.",Tripadvisor
Interesting place to wander round with gorgeous views of the torii gate and the sea. we had our guide with us which was great as she knew a lot about it.,Tripadvisor
"A beautiful shrine and torii gate to see, especially during low tide. Fascinating island with lots of shops and places to eat along the pathway.",Tripadvisor
平日とはいえ混雑を避けるため8時前のフェリーで渡りました。大鳥居までは歩けませんでしたが近くまで歩ける干潮時間で朱の社殿と大鳥居のコントラストに暫し見入りました。社殿の回廊も人が少なく美しさを引き立てていました。屋根の修繕が行われており檜皮を打ちこむ音が小気味よく響いていました。何回訪れても素晴らしい景色です。,Tripadvisor
"We visited Miyajima Island during the later afternoon. Arrived by fast ferry offered by the Hiiroshima World Heritage Sea Route (AKA Aqua Net Hiroshima). Where we departed from the bridge, near the Atomic Dome site, directly to Miyajima port in 40-45 minutes.

Unfortunately it was low tide and the Shrine and O-Torii Gate (Grand Torri Gate) were not floating in the Seto Island Sea. Regardless the Shine itself is a beautiful complex of buildings and raised walkways. Every vista is a feast for the eyes. Surrounded in a cove with Mount Misen as the backdrop. From here, there are great shots of the Pagoda, the mountain, the sea and the surrounding area.

This Shrine is a Holy site and National Treasure. The site dates back four hundred of years and the present Torri Gate more than 100 years.

Highly recommend a visit and we hope to return again.",Tripadvisor
"Located just beside the sea, this ancient shrine offers you a serene atmosphere & wonderful views of the combination of manmade beauty and natural beauty prevalent in the area.",Tripadvisor
"We arrived for the high tide and weren't disappointed. The walk to the Shrine from the ferry terminal isn't too far. You can take photos of the tori gate as you approach the shrine and you don't need to go into the shrine to get a good photo of the gate. We did walk around the shrine, there is a one way walk around the shrine which is quite interesting in itself. There are lots of shops around between the ferry terminal and the shrine so plenty of options for eating or souvenirs. It wasn't too busy.",Tripadvisor
We took the ferry over to Miyajima Island to visit this Buddhist temple. We had a pleasant walk from the terminal to the temple and when we got there there was some renovation going on. When we were there the tide was going out so the temple had no water around it. If you wish to stop and pray or meditate I'm sure they wouldn’t mind.,Tripadvisor
"A must-see place in Miyajima. The tide was out when we arrived, so the shrine wasn't as spectacular as it would have been had it been surrounded by water. The tide was in by the time we left the island and the floating Torri Gate was stunning",Tripadvisor
如果要拍到退潮鸟居和涨潮鸟居，记得一定要呆够6小时以上哦。我们就是因为时间关系，只能看到退潮鸟居，不失为一大遗憾。,Tripadvisor
"Très beau sanctuaire que j'ai visité pour la deuxième fois toujours avec le même plaisir. Merveilleux jeux de lumière entre les colonnes, structure sur pilotis exceptionnelle. Par contre, peu de décorations, ce qui en décevra peut-être quelques uns. Visiter de préférence tôt le matin après une nuit sur l'île.",Tripadvisor
"Der Tori Bogen im Wasser ist schon ein toller Anblick, den man mal gesehen haben muss. Um den Bogen ist relativ viel los, es tümmeln sich Touristen und Rehe. Aber man findet trotzdem ein Plätzchen für ein paar gute Bilder. Für den Besuch des Tempels und den Tori sollte man die Ebbe und Flut Zeiten nachschauen. Beim Tempel sollte man früh morgens da sein.",Tripadvisor
"If you’re in Tokyo, it’s definitely one of the things to “experience.”

"After a satisfying lunch at Hayashi, we continued our stroll and found the Torii ""floating"" in the bay. We're lucky since the repairs were just finished. It is beautiful, but not magical. I understand that it is one of three icons of Japan.
The theatre on the street forefront was more interesting. Deer know to loiter here where all the visitors stop to look. They look for opportunities to eat their food, steal their bags, and eventually become an aggressive pest. They know to take advantage of children by stealing their ice cream cone or bag of chips. One particular deer came upon our group, and stole and munched on Sandy's brochure about the Atomic Museum.",Tripadvisor
10月下旬九州からの観光客として参拝しました。家人も私も高校の修学旅行以来。混み合う直前に参拝できて、ラッキー！　そこかしこに賽銭箱があり、参拝順路の終点に辿り着く遥か前にコイン底つき。トホホ！　一番印象に残ったのは狛犬の尻尾。なんじゃそりゃ！,Tripadvisor
A beautiful shrine built on water on Miyajima. I visited during low tide but I guess it looks magical at high tide. Unfortunately it is extremely crowded and you can't really enjoy the atmosphere of the place.,Tripadvisor
"This is a must-see if you are in the area. Avoid the crowds by spending the night in one of the hotels. You'll be able to walk out to the gate at low tide early in the morning before the first ferry arrives. You'll also be able to explore and get photos without the huge crowds. It gets super crowded by 11 AM so be prepared if you are coming later in the day.
The gate really is a marvel. I took pictures of it throughout the day and enjoyed every minute of it.
I came with my mom we had a great time. I don't think my elementary aged children would have enjoyed/appreciated the experience.",Tripadvisor
世界遺産の厳島神社。何十年ぶりに再訪いたしました。神社はあちらこちら修理中で少々残念な感じですが、これはこれで今しか逆に見れないのでありかなと。,Tripadvisor
20年ほど前のお正月に行き、暖かく晴れていて、すごくよかったのを記憶している。今回は大鳥居は修繕中で、鳥居に飾ってある扁額が、間近で見れるのを知り行きました。行ってみると鳥居には工事の足場が組まれていて、姿は見えませんでしたね。社殿で船側扁額(表)と社殿側扁額(裏)が飾ってあり、間近で見れたのがすごく良かったです。鳥居に近づけてもこんな感じで見れないし、字体もはっきり見えて良かったです。説明もあったので行った甲斐があり、勉強になりました。記念にご朱印を頂いて帰りました。,Tripadvisor
日本国内でも有数の神社です。創建は6世紀末と伝えられ安芸国一之宮で世界文化遺産にも登録されています。鳥居が工事中でしたが、それでも朱色の長い回廊を歩き、ここも平清盛公や毛利元就公も歩いたのかなと考えると心が震えます。訪問時は干潮なので海に浮かぶ様子は見られないのが残念でした。次回は「秋」「修繕終了」「満潮時」の三点を考えて来てみたいものです。,Tripadvisor
安芸国の一之宮で、水中に浮かぶ鳥居と本殿が有名です。現在は鳥居も本殿の一部も修繕工事中で、ちょっと残念ですが、ご利益は衰えません。時間帯によっては潮の満ち引きがありますので、当日の満潮時間に合わせて訪れた方がよろしいかと思います。,Tripadvisor
"広島県廿日市市の厳島（宮島）にある神社。
弥山のある宮島は聖地中の聖地。従って、厳島神社は聖地宮島を傷つけないように、島ではなく、海上に創建されたとのこと。
全国に約500社ある厳島神社の総本社である。平成8（1996）年12月にユネスコの世界文化遺産に「厳島神社」として登録されている。
「神を斎き祀る島」という語源のように、古くから島そのものが神として信仰されていた。推古天皇元年（593年）、1423年前に佐伯鞍職が創建。その後、平清盛が、安芸守になったことにより、嚴島神社を厚く信仰。武士として初めて太政大臣となった清盛は、仁安3年（1168年）頃に現在のような寝殿造りの海上社殿を造営したといいます。その後、1571年に毛利氏によって本殿の改築や反橋や大鳥居の再建など大規模な修復が行われたそうです。
社殿裏手を流れる御手洗川（紅葉谷川）。その名の通り往時にはここで禊をして、厳島神社に参拝したと言われている。潮の満ち引きのある場所に建つ寝殿造りの社殿群と大鳥居から成る。宮島全体が神と捉えられていたため、「ご神体」を傷つけないようにと潮の満ち引きのある場所に造られたといわれています。
瀬戸内海を往来する漁民や、商人たちの「嚴島詣」が盛んになっていき、江戸時代には伊勢詣、四国遍路と並んで西国の民衆の代表的な参詣地として流行したようです。御本社の祓殿正面にある高舞台は、大阪の四天王寺・住吉大社の石舞台とともに「日本三大舞台」といわれています。嚴島神社の神事である「管絃祭」は毎年旧暦の6月17日に行われています。入口を入り、東廻廊を進むと最初にたどりつくのが客神社です。4つの社殿から摂社のなかで最も大きい神社であり、天忍穂耳命、天穂日命、天津彦根命、活津彦根命、熊野櫞樟日命の五男神を祀っています。本殿をはじめ拝殿、祓殿などがあり、三女神と呼ばれる市杵島姫命、田心姫命、湍津姫命を祀っています。三女神は海の神、交通運輸の神、財福の神、技芸の神として厚く信仰されている。干潮時には砂浜から水が湧きだし形作る「鏡池」が、境内3か所に出現する。
沖合約200メートルのところに立つ大鳥居は、平清盛の頃から何度か建て替えられ、現在のものは明治8年（1875年）に再建され8代目に当たる。高さ16メートル、重さ約60トンもの巨大な大鳥居。現在は補修工事中で、工事用足場に囲まれて、その姿を観ることができません。実は6本の柱の足元は海底に埋めておらず、自らの重みだけで立っている。
客神社から御本社へと続く朱塗りの鮮やかな廻廊で、入口の屋根は切妻造、西廻廊側の屋根は唐破風造。西廻廊には学問の神を祀る天神社があります。",Tripadvisor
"フェリー降り場から表参道商店街経由で、ゆっくり歩いて15分ほどで到着しました。
鮮やかな朱色の柱が印象的でした。ただ大鳥居が改築中のためやぐらに囲まれていて見えなかったのが残念でした。あと周辺に鹿が2頭しかいませんでした。
大鳥居の改修が早く終わることを祈りたいと思います。",Tripadvisor
"7月下旬の水曜日の訪問です。
ずっと来たかった宮島・厳島神社、やっと来れました。
サラリーマン時代、何度も広島県に出張に来てたのに、宮島に観光に行けなかった事を後悔しておりました。
宮島上陸前にうえのさんで名物・あなごめしで腹ごしらえをして、12:15の満潮の時間に合わせて待望の厳島神社を訪問しました。
清盛や毛利元就の時代に想いをはせて、歴史を感じながら堪能できました。
あいにく大鳥居が改修工事なのですが、そのおかげで大鳥居に掲げられていた扁額が拝殿前に展示されており、まじかに拝見することができました。",Tripadvisor
宮島の代名詞といえる場所です。創建されたのが593年という極めて長い歴史を誇ります。その厳島神社を厚く信仰した平清盛によっ現在のような独特な社殿が作られたそうです。現在は看板とも言える大鳥居が工事中ですが、それ以外も十分美しいです。,Tripadvisor
"One of the 3 iconic/scenic site of Japan and it's worth visiting. Before I went, I found that the Torii gate is under renovation (ie. totally covered), so I was hesitant abt making the trip to Miyajima. When I bite the bullet to make the trip, I was surprised that the cover on the gate was removed. Only some of part of the temporary bridge for the renovation/construction was still visible but I was satisfied enough to see the gate uncovered on Nov 28. I guess by now, all construction and renovation stuff were removed.

There were lots of people (locals and foreigners) in the shrine, it helps to go early to avoid crowds.

Some said to see both the shrine and torii gate in both high and low tides but I did not have time for it. Headed to the shrine and gate once I got off the ferry and then headed to take the ropeway for Misen's observatory.",Tripadvisor
"This is a fantastic Island to visit and the shrine is stunning.
It has a very ancient history dating back to 593 , the present building being constructed in 1168, This place has been worshipped by the Japanese for centuries.
A world heritage listed site it is very well maintained and it is always busy .
Entry fee is 300 Yen.
We were on the island all day so saw it with the tide out and in , great planning by the people who put it all together generations ago .
We really enjoyed our visit",Tripadvisor

Il tempio vero e proprio a terra non é un gran che anche se l""insieme é stato inserito nel patrimonio culturale dell'Unesco.
Molto meglio il tempio retrostante sulla collina (da non perdere)",Tripadvisor
"This is a very, very busy place. Many groups are visiting, especially on the weekends. The shrine itself and the famous O-Torii Gate are historically and culturally important, but due to the masses of people did not excite as that much. However, after walking just a few hundred meters away from the bustling shrine we encountered a wonderful ensemble of temples st the end of little road. The atmosphere in and around Chokugande Temple etc was just tranquillant with very few people finding their way there. This spot was worth the trip.
We took a ferry boat directly from the peace park to the island which took 45 minutes. Very recommendable.",Tripadvisor
The shrine is adjacent to the famous floating tori gate. Unlike many other shrines it is not necessary to remove shoes. It is in excellent condition and we saw a wedding in progress. It is also adjacent to a 5 level pagoda which is also in excellent condition,Tripadvisor

Son muchos los edificios para recorrer. Y además está el Gran Torii. En nuestra visita el agua se encontraba baja, retirada. Por lo tanto pudimos llegar hasta el Torii, estar al lado de sus pilares. Emocionante.

2度目の訪問になります。前回は50年も前になります。もちろん当時島には高級ホテルや沢山のお店も少なかった。宮島のシンボルは世界遺産厳島神社、10時前に到着し満潮時を期待していたのですが、この日はこの時間あいにくの引き潮。海の上に浮かぶ様は拝めませんでした。潮の満ち引きはその日により違うので旅行者は満潮時を期待するのは難しいです。それでも赤い大鳥居と朱色の神社の造りは美しく、山や海の風景とマッチしています。また海外の方々も多く、魅力的な場所と感じているのかも知れません。,Tripadvisor
"When my friend and I visited there, I felt so relaxed and majestic. Took some photos that are fantastic cause the crowd looks like a dragon! I really want to come back.",Tripadvisor
"This is a shinto shrine on Miyajima island. It's a very large place, painted all red, set on pillars just above the lapping sea at the shoreline. It gets very busy & crowded.

このアイディアは非常にいい　昔の人が考えたのはすごい事

"出張の隙間時間をぬって宮島観光に行きました。
原爆ドーム付近の桟橋から高速船が出ていて、乗船時間45分、宮島桟橋から徒歩で10分程度で着きました。
大鳥居は残念ながら改修工事中で、令和元年6月から来年までかかるとのことです。
大鳥居が見れなくても、神社自体も綺麗で海辺に佇む姿は一見の価値ありかと思います。
また大鳥居の改修が終わった頃に観光に来ます。

原爆ドーム付近から出ている高速船(世界遺産航路)は往復4000円と少し割高にはなりますが、無駄な移動時間を省けてとても便利だと思います。ホームページから予約できますが前日23時までの予約が必要で、当日になると現地で空きがあれば乗れるという感じです。",Tripadvisor

The shrine is located on Miyajima Island. To get there you must take a ten minute ferry ride.

There are platforms to walk around on so that you can actually go to the shrine and explore.,Tripadvisor

浜に降りるつもりならある程度は汚れても良い靴を履いていきましょう。",Tripadvisor
After a short ferry ride you arrive at the location and walk around the area. It was such an experience to see the Tori gate. There are quite a few deer as you are walking around and the place is quite peaceful. They have lovely little stores selling souveniers and a must is to try the BBQ oysters. They are the best. They are so large and you only get two but are so worth it. Actually most of the food in this area was great and the shaved ice with strawberry topping is so refreshing on a hot day. Lots to see and you should allow more than two hours.,Tripadvisor
"De must see in Miyajima is helaas een jaar “under construction” en helemaal ingepakt. Vaag zie je de tori door het canvas. Maar het klooster dat ervoor ligt, is ook meer dan de moeite waard. Wij zagen een aantal ceremoniën, maar ook zonder dit extraatje moet je voor het klooster de tijd nemen. Bij vloed ligt het mooi in het water en bij eb.... .",Tripadvisor
"妻との広島旅行の２日目に訪問しました。
広島市内から車で３０分すこしで宮島口に到着。割高でしたがフェリー乗り場に近い駐車場に車を停め、フェリーの往復券を購入し乗船。約１０分で宮島に着き、参道をぼちぼちと歩いて厳島神社に到着。朱色の世界が広がります。大鳥居は自然災害のため、現在改修中で足場とネットに囲まれていますが、こればかりは仕方ない
ため再訪の際の楽しみとしたいと思います。
最近、夫婦共々御朱印集めを始めましたが、御朱印受付は長蛇の列。まあ体育の日を含む３連休最終日なので覚悟はしていました。しかし、御朱印を書いてもらった若い女性がご友人と「こんなの遠くから来た甲斐がない」と何やら怒り心頭で話されています。私は順番待ちの列が長くならないように、並んでいる妻の近くから見ておりましたが、順番が回ってくると女性が怒る意味がよくわかりました。若い方と年配の方が御朱印を書いておられましたが、年配の方の対応があまりにも酷い。
連休でたくさんの御朱印を書かれ疲れているのはわかりますが、高圧的な言動は参拝した人に対するものではなく、あまりにも非礼で見ていた私も不快感を覚えました。ホームページで名社と謳っているのに残念極まりないものでした。幸い私たちは若い方に順番が回ったのでほっとしました。
再訪の際には御朱印は頂くことはありませんが、今後、神社側の改善・指導は必要かと思いました。",Tripadvisor
家族で訪問。鳥居が改修中だったのは少し残念。周辺の店は５時～６時で閉まるので注意。世界中のひとに訪れてほしい、海と融合した神社。夕方の時間にいくと水面に映る神殿が見られるのでおすすめです。,Tripadvisor
Was very sad that this Shrine was totally under cover. This was one of the Shrines I really wanted to see.,Tripadvisor
"This shrine is located on Miyajima island a short ferry boat trip across from Hiroshima.
The shrine has a huge Tori gate in the water out the front but we were unable to view this as it was covered in scaffolding. The shrine was first built in 593 and rebuilt in 1168 and has survived to the present.
There are more than 20 buildings suspended in the water.
This is also a world heritage site.
The brightly vermillion coloured shrine contrasts vividly with the green hills and the sea.
Recommended",Tripadvisor
Don't go there if this is all you want to see as it's covered in scaffolding and white shroud. You can still get a feel for how it might look. Also if you can research the tide timetables that will enhance the visit. Otherwise you can walk on the sand!,Tripadvisor
"Beautiful shrine. We were sorry to see the main landmark was under construction so we couldn't see the full beauty of it.
But absolutely Georges.",Tripadvisor
"世界遺産の厳島神社ですが、大鳥居が改修が始まっており、工事終了日程は未定との事となっていました。ちょっと残念な訪問となってしまいました。
厳島神社本殿自体の観光は出来て、ちょうど訪れた日程が干潮から満潮の風景まで楽しめて良かったです。",Tripadvisor
大鳥居は改装中ですが、神社はふつうに参拝することができます。おすすめは満潮時、そうでなくとも神社の床下に海水があるときです。大小さまざまなフグは簡単にみつけることができ、かわいいです。今回はエイもいました（見づらいですが、一応写真に写っています…）。,Tripadvisor
"Even though we are Christians this Shrine is very serene, peaceful, and spiritual. Unfortunately there were renovations being done on the actual shrine but everything surrounding the shrine was well worth the visit. Fabulous place to visit.",Tripadvisor
"When you go to Hiroshima station you can’t mis the train. They guide you towards the platform. In the train the will announce the station where you need to get out. On the platform is someone waiting with a big JR board to guide you to the port accross the street where a big JR signe says where you need to go for the right boat to the shrine. Perfect but......... you can’t see the shrine, it’s wrapped up in a tent. I said to my wife, it’s like when you go to the louvre to see the Mona Lisa and after half a day searching you find out its not there because they need to clean it or whatever and they didn’t told you",Tripadvisor
"潮が引いていると歩いて鳥居まで行くことができます。

"嚴島神社因興建在海灘上，會因潮汐而每天作出不同變化。我去的那天，神社早上是藍天沙灘，下午卻襯托着流動的海水。 潮汐是因地球的自轉和月球的引力而造成。

Le grand Tori est en Réparation pour 2 ans...jusque en 2021...donc tu vois rien qu’une grosse boîte blanche ou est situé le Grand Tori. En plus si tu veut un effet spectaculaire n’oublie pas les marées sinon tu va voir un temple et un Tori sur le sable,Tripadvisor

"De repente, no ferry que vem de Hiroshima, ouve-se um zunzunzun , todos se movem para um lado e começam a tirar fotos: é o tori flutuante. É realmente lindo! O templo é muito bem preservado e vc pode fotografar-se enquadrado no tori - numa filinha muito bem organizada como é costume no Japão. De lá faça seu tour por Miyajima, que é uma graça!",Tripadvisor
"フェリーが着いた港から、喧騒の土産店がなどが並ぶ道を抜けると ドーンと現れます。

宮島からフェリーに乗って数分、赤い鳥居を間近に見ながら宮島の桟橋へ。

"EStabamos alojados en Hiroshima y viajamos con el JR pass para ver el santuario. Tuvimos que madrugar mucho ya que la pleamar era a las 8 de la mañana y la siguiente ya era muy tarde. Merece la pena porque no es lo mismo con agua que sin ella y el santuario enseguida queda sin ella. La estación está a unos 200m. del ferry, también cubierto por el JR pass. En la isla también se pueden ver algunos ciervos, pero a diferencia de Nara no se les puede dar de comer y tampoco hay tantos. Tanto el santuario como el Torii son muy bonitos y mereció la pena el madrugón porque había poca gente, cuando nos ibamos al mediodía estaba todo muy concurrido. Aprovechamos para subir hasta la cascada y el templo budista, un paseo muy bonito.",Tripadvisor
"干潮を狙って行きましたが、肝心の鳥居が工事中。
御朱印をもらおうとしたが、行列が尋常ではなく諦めた。
台風や高潮で被害が出る度に復旧費用に寄進を求めている神社。御朱印は原価タダの丸儲けなんだから、行列が発生しない仕組みを考えねばならんだろうに。",Tripadvisor
"Arriving at Hiroshima Port as part of our Maasdam cruise encircling Japan, we exited the Port Terminal, walking 1 km west to the Port Passenger Terminal to take its hourly Miyajima Island Ferry($18 each). The 30 minute sail crossed the beautiful bay passing all types of watercraft that service this busy and vast harbor.
The large multi wharf Miyajima Ferry Terminal is the entry to a small village of tourist shops, restaurants and hotels, surprisingly including several cars and service trucks. We followed the visitors 200 m along the seafront to the prominent UNESCO stone inscription, then 200 m more passing the stone torigi and stone lantern pathway to see the huge Vermilion Gate at low tide fronting the large colonnaded shrine.
After paying $3 each, we entered a colonnade, passing the 5 story pagoda built in 1407, then surprisingly, a procession of white robed shrine priests. Strolling the interlocking wooden walkways revealed the main shrine, stone temple lions and views up the beautiful forested slopes.
We backtracked to the JR Ferry($2 each) for the 10 minute crossing to the mainland, then walked 200 m to the JR Miyajima-guchi Station to board its each 10 minute train. 15 minutes later, we exited at the Nishi-hiroshima Station and transferred to Streetcar #2 for 9 stops exiting at the Atomic Bomb Dome. After viewing the Peace Memorial Park, we walked 300 m to City Hall for the provided Port Bus back to our waiting Maasdam.
Remarkably, we were never far away from a clean restroom, making for a nice all day visit to this large historical city.",Tripadvisor
"Bella location sicuramente vale la pena andare, a poche decine di minuti di battello. Suggestivo il tori in acqua (anche se era ingabbiato dalle impalcature) e bellissimo il percorso all'interno del tempio scintoista.
Suggestiva anche la strada per arrivarci dal porto costellata di negozi e posti caratteristici in cui mangiare.",Tripadvisor
"日本三景の一つで、国内外から観光客が訪れる安芸の宮島。本州側の宮島口桟橋からフェリーに乗船し海を渡っていくと、厳島神社の大鳥居が近づきワクワクと胸が高まります。

厳島神社と書いて、「いつくしまじんじゃ」と読みます。意外と読めない日本人:知り合いがいまして、「げんとうじんじゃ」と豪語し、同行したメンバーは大笑い(≧▽≦)

もう、どんだけ～笑わせるのかと問えば本人はいたって真面目に答える。この人と話すと、何もかもが間違えて脳内インプットされそうだわ😅

また、寄り道をしてしまった😁

この「厳島神社」は、推古天皇元年(593年)の創建と伝わり、仁安3年(1168年)に平清盛(たいらのきよもり)の援助で現在のような海に立つ社殿を造営。

社殿は平安貴族の住宅様式である“寝殿造り”を取り入れたもの。

平清盛は京に並々ならぬ思いがありましたからね💡

潮の干満で見られる姿が変わり、満潮時には本当に海に浮かんでいるようで、幻想的ですね。

朱色の柱が連なる廻廊(かいろう)を通り、平舞台から正面に望む大鳥居の景色は圧巻。

廻廊の長さは約275m。床板には、“目透し”という隙間があり、高潮などの波のパワーを分散して建物を守る設計を持ちますが、ハイヒール👠などの履き物は、隙間に挟まる事があるので、ウォーキングシューズがお勧め。

その大鳥居は地中に柱を埋め込まずに、大鳥居自身の重さで立っているというから驚きますね。

1996年に世界遺産に登録されてからは、観光客も絶えない人気のある観光地です。

障害者手帳、療育手帳を提示し参拝しましょう。

"Posto pittoresco anche se il tori è al momento tutto ingabbiato per ristrutturazione. Il tempio tutto rosso è bello all’esterno, dentro non ha granché da vedere ma essendo sul mare rimane un posto comunque bello da visitare",Tripadvisor

"みなさんが高評価されるこの場所を実際に自分の目で確かめてみようと訪れた。
時期はまだヒトの動きがあまり活発でなかった日に朝一番日の出の頃に参拝。
流石に誰もいない。朝の澄んだ空気が心地いい。噂に聞く千本鳥居が目にも鮮やかに飛び込んでくる。しかしながら…、みなさんがおっしゃるパワーや神聖さは微塵も感じられず、唯々鳥居の普請に相当な金子をかき集めたであろう背景が頭をよぎり、その生々しさになんだかげんなりしながら階段を上がっていった。
普段の朝イチの参拝はどこでもなんだか得したような気分になってすれ違う人みなさんと互いに挨拶し合うような雰囲気になるものだが、私の性根が腐っているのと、皆さん階段を上がるのに一生懸命なのが相まってそうはならなかったのが残念だった。

We reached Mt Fuji to be greeted by chilly winds. What a view..",Tripadvisor
"While I waited for my guide to arrive, I observed every tourist walked through the main gate. Most of them said ""Wow!"" or something similar as they entered the castle ground. Himeji Castle truly was an impressive castle. Most of the castles in Japan had been burnt or destroyed by war, but Himeji Castle survived WWII bombings and stood still. This large castle is in the original state, and it is magnificent. You can see it from the Himeji train station, but when you are inside of the gate, you will find yourself finding many photo opportunities. I cannot imagine how fabulous it would be to have a cherry blossom viewing party here!
I made a reservation for a free tour with the Himeji Castle English Speaking Guide Group a month ahead. Our guide grew up in Himeji, and we learnt a lot about the castle and surrounding area.
I also reserved luggage storage in the station area, but it seems that there were a plenty of large lockers. I used ecbo cloak because I wanted to be sure that I had a place to store my luggage before I arrived. Don't give up on visiting Himeji because of your luggage storage requirement.
To be honest, Himeji Castle was not on the list of places to visit during my recent trip. I needed to meet a friend of mine in Osaka after visiting Hiroshima, and Himeji happened to be in between. I am glad that we visited Himeji Castle and requested for a guide. I will remember my visit to Himeji Castle for the rest of my life.",Tripadvisor

We stopped at the information centre and watched a very informative short film about the volcano and then drove up the steep tree covered slopes to the fifth station which was covered in snow and very cold!
There were masses of shops and restaurants there but we could not see the peak from there as we were in the clouds.",Tripadvisor
"n 6/26/2023 my girlfriend and I visited Himeji Castle. We walked 1/2 hour from the train station along the main road which was lined with beautiful and interesting statues. At the end of the road was the beautiful and imposing Himeji Castle. We purchased tickets at 9am and an English speaking volunteer tour guide, Isamu Takumi, offered us a tour of the Castle. For about 1 1/2 hours he gave us a wonderful tour that brought the castle to life. We heard that a Ninja and Bond Movie had been filmed here and learned about the architecture, history and construction of the castle. It is a very impressive place and it is very beautiful and well maintained. Himeji Castle is well worth a visit and the guided tour provided so much information and relatable stories. We visited the Gardens too and enjoyed the blooming hydrangea.",Tripadvisor
It’s hard to beat the natural beauty of Mt Fuji if the skies are clear. Winter gets really cold on the top.,Tripadvisor

"MUST SEE!!! And take a Free Guide

We were not sure about going to Himeji castle as our travel plans clashed with it, LUCKYLY WE DID GO!!!!

This castle is an absolute masterpiece and Isamu Takumi, (our Free guide from the VEGA Volunteer Guide association of Himeji Castle) made us go back in time and feel like part of an army trying to take the castle.

Takumi knew everything and he was patient to answer all our silly questions with an Excellent English!!

"Climbing Mt. Fuji is probably the most intense experience of my life so far. It was absolutely amazing, and someday I might even do it again. So, let’s see if I can help you with your planning too...

Q. Is hiking Mt. Fuji for you?
A. Well, my husband, tweenage son, and I are all pretty fit. Hubby was on track and regularly pushes himself harder than I do. The child takes fitness classes. I take fitness classes and hike regularly when the weather allows. Nothing prepared us for this. Still, after all of it, we visited a hot spring afterwards because we could barely move. Our legs were so sore!!! On the other hand, we saw an elderly woman and her middle aged daughter climbing (though they turned back before the 8th station). We saw one family carrying their teenage son with disabilities up to 8th. We saw casual foreigners who hadn’t packed for overnight. We also saw many local tourists drop off after 8th station. So, really, it depends on what you’re willing to put into this and your level of health and endurance.

Q. How was it, really?
A. Awful. And wonderful. And amazing. And I wouldn’t trade that back for most anything! When we started out, it was foggy, rainy, and lush. The trail was packed; there were literal traffic jams. And then the switchbacks started. And then the terrain changed (first loose rocks, then spider monkey climbing straight up, then more switchbacks.... endless, endless switchbacks!) Traffic decreased. Interestingly, there was internet service on the climb up. My husband’s smart watch told him infuriatingly, “Typical Wednesday. Keep up the pace!” I found that most of the stations were Pokestops! I think one of the best things about climbing this beast is the people. There’s quite a variety. Trails are jammed with daytrippers and people who overestimate their ability. These drop off as you close in on 8th station. Past that, it becomes something for the strong willed. People shout down to you: “Ganbatte!” (You can do it! Keep going!) and honestly it HELPS to know so many other people are struggling with you. I highly recommend getting the walking stick and having it stamped as you go; not only is it a nice distraction, but it’s a major once in a lifetime souvenir. Ours’ is hanging over the fireplace.

Q. Tell me about the climb up.
A. Well, my son and I suffered altitude sickness pretty early on, so we had slow going. Every single switchback was torture. We made it to Taishikan at the 8th station and thought we were close to the top. We spent the night there and saw the sun rise over the clouds. It was so tear-jerkingly beautiful! The few hours we rested at the hut were restless though, so we pressed on early in the morning. As we got higher, people and plant life were sparse (though there were still a lot of flying insects). It felt like I could fall right off the edge into the clouds at any moment. My son cried as we neared the torii at the top. I’m so proud of him for making it!

Q. What about the descent?
A. Oh, man. We thought we were sore and tired at the top. Ha! A few people told us the descent takes about half the time as the climb. Not true when you’re exhausted and sore. Climbing down declines stresses your muscles like crazy. Now do that a million more times, because that’s what the switchbacks are like in reverse. Loose stone that shifts beneath your feet make for a rough descent. We fell frequently and the walking stick became an important tool. We learned to walk backwards to stretch out other muscles. As rough as the descent was, we also went through several clouds as storms passed, which was one of the coolest things I’ve ever experienced. We had tiny droplets of water stuck all over us; my son pointed out that we had “cloud hair” :) At times the clouds were so thick we quickly lost sight of one another, but really there’s only one way you can go, so...

Q. What else should I know?
A. Read reviews. I didn’t need the gaiters we purchased, but my son loved them. No one told me sunscreen would be imperative to have; we all spent the rest of our trip intensely burned on the areas of our faces our goggles and glasses didn’t cover. Bring change for the restrooms, as they’re mostly all 200 yen per use. Pack a LOT of water. It gets more expensive the higher you go. Pack bags to keep your garbage in (there are no garbage cans on the mountain).

Q. When is the best time to go?
A. We went during the intense heat of the summer (95 F). What that meant was that it was perfect for climbing Mt. Fuji. We started in shorts, put on long sleeved shirts halfway up, and changed into pants and light jacket near the top. I wore shorts, then yoga pants; a tee shirt, then a light jacket; earmuffs for wind protection and big sunglasses. I hiked in sneakers that I still wear to the gym every day. There wasn’t much snow, but I hate cold weather, so this was perfect for me. I definitely recommend going in the heat of summer. Make sure you plan some down time afterwards! This will be the most arduous, memorable thing you do in Japan!",Tripadvisor
"Himeji is an engineering and defensive marvel. The castle is one of the more impressive pieces of architecture in Japan. The outside is breathtaking. The inside was built as a defensive stronghold, so it is mostly empty tiers. One of the top 10 things to see in Japan.",Tripadvisor

"A very impressive castle and if you visit you'll understand why it is so popular. At the entrance you can take a free ""Himeji Castle Concierge Book"" which is an excellent guide on your tour through the grounds. The stairs in the keep are not as steep and narrow as in other castles I've been to. You can also enter the bailey which houses enlightening exhibitions.
There will be crowds but it is definitely worth your visit. Make sure to set aside enough time for your visit and get a combination ticket which gives you entrance to nearby Koko-en.",Tripadvisor
"Catching the JR ‘rapid train’ we travelled ~100km south of Osaka to the township of Himeji; famous for the “Hakuroju” (White Heron Castle) - because of its brilliant white exterior and supposed resemblance to a white heron taking flight. Dating back to circa 1613, it is world heritage listed - and was worth the trip. Well preserved, it is famous for its (5 storey) central Keep; Moats; Passage ways and surrounding Gardens. We spent quite a few hours exploring. Was really good.",Tripadvisor
"Very popular visitor attraction, around ¥1000 for entry. You'll need some stamina, a couple of hours, and patience. Well worth the climb of 5 floors of steep, narrow old timber stairs, you can see not only the historical castle - the home of samurai, ninjas, and warlords - but also the adjoining gardens. Dating back to 1346, this is a UNESCO site.",Tripadvisor
"The good bit is that this is a really impressive original castle, looks beautiful, and feels very authentic. The bad bit is that lots of people think the same, not unreasonably, and so if you want to go inside it is a fairly fast-moving continuous queue before, during and after, a large part of which is in your socks on slippery wooden floors and staircases. I imagine more people have been killed falling down the stairs than ever were shot with an arrow from the battlements. But you can peel off in a couple of places and breathe/look at the amazing wooodwork inside and the impressive views outside. Very easy to get to from the station, but we should have allowed a bit more time ( we were en route from Kyoto to Kumamoto). Probably a couple of hours would be comfortable. As always, compared to the UK, very reasonable entrance fee",Tripadvisor

"Le chateau d'Himeji faisait partie des highlights de notre séjour et nous n'avons pas été déçus, il est superbe et absolument majestueux.
La visite complète du chateau nous a pris plus de 3h (sans compter les jardins un peu plus loin) en faisant ce qui est décrit comme le grand tour, mais nous avons dû faire la queue pour accéder au donjon, qui en fait ne présentait pas beaucoup d'intérêt. Par contre ne pas manquer la visite des batiments à gauche après l'entrée.
Enchainez ensuite sur les jardins ;)

"We weren't sure about visiting Himeji since it's afar from where we were staying - but oh boy! Himeji Castle should be on everyone's West JP itinerary. The exteriors are breathtaking and there are so much more inside for your discovery - so don't trust the reviews about how ""underwhelming"" the interiors are *wink wink*! Himeji Castle also offer free tour guide service to all visitors and we are so glad to have Hideyo (our volunteer guide) showing us around. Hideyo was very passionate and knowledgeable. She told and showed us all the intricate architectural details of the castle - which would clearly be missed out if you didn't have a guide with you. She was engaging and witty, and we had a lot of convos during our visit. I studied Asian History and Architecture back in college so seeing the castle in person was a dream come true.

Hideyo took pictures for us and even showed us the hidden photo-taking spots that most tourists ignored. Hideyo really was the best!! We had such a great time in the castle, even though my friend had absolutely 0 knowledge or interest in history. So.... make sure you talk to the volunteer guides at the entrance and ask them for free tour!!!",Tripadvisor

"히메지성은 1993년 일본 최초의 세계문화유산으로 나라의 <호류지>와 함께 유네스코 세계문화유산에 등재되었습니다. 일본의 목조 건물 중 최고의 미적 완성도를 보이며 보존상태도 훌륭하기 때문에 일본 제일의 성이라는 평가를 받고 있습니다. 히메지성은 흰색의 외벽과 날개 모양의 지붕이 마치 백로의 모습과 닮았다고 하여 <백로성>이라고 불리기도 합니다.
히메지성은 나지막한 언덕 위에 있기 때문에 <천수각>에 올라가면 히메지시 전체를 내려다 볼 수 있으니 꼭 <천수각>에 올라가시기를 추천합니다.

"The Himeji castle is definitely worth a trip from Osaka or on the way to Hiroshima! It is much nicer and larger than Osaka castle and easy to get to from the train station. You can either take a bus or just walk - you can see it from the exit of the train station. We bought a combination ticket for the castle and Koko-en, the gardens next door. There are lockers to store your belongings right before you enter the castle grounds, as well as restrooms and vending machines for one last drink of water. There is a steep walk up to the entrance of the castle, and then you will walk up steep flights of stairs to get to the top. It's totally doable and totally worth it for the views. You will need to take off your shoes and put them into a bag, so wear or brings socks. We had very few other people there when we visited, so ew got to see everything without obstruction. There is a small shrine at the top, and there are also information displays in English on each floor to tell you the highlights of the building. Highly recommend if you are in the area!",Tripadvisor
"We were lucky, we had gorgeous weather and the cherry blossoms were in full bloom. We spoke to other travellers who had spent a week at Kawaguchiko Lake and never once saw the mountain. But we did, and that's what counts! The mountain is magnificent in its majestic beauty and I well understand why it is revered. The best time to take tours is early morning before the could start piling up. There are many ways to experience Fuji...... all very worthwhile.",Tripadvisor

gros défauts mais je vais m expliquer
Il est impératif lorsque l on est à kyoto de faire ce château en effet extérieurement c est magnifique niveau photos on se régale par contre l intérieur c est fade à part monter et descendre tous les étages en bois il y a rien à voir pas d arme (si 3 fusil et 2 lances) pas de mannequins ou d explications c est vraiment dommage car ça pourrait être plus sympa et enrichissant de mon côté j ai acheté un livre pour avoir plus d explication voilà voilà",Tripadvisor
"The iconic mountain of Japan. On a clear day, you can actually see it just from outside the centre of Tokyo. A bus to the mountain takes about 2 hours. There’s plenty of options to visit the mountain, but I think booking a tour would be the easiest and most efficient way if it’s your first time visiting Japan.",Tripadvisor
"I find all of Japan full of mountains as we took bullet train from tokyo to osaka. Took a day trip and found much more .Nice little village at base. where you could get great souvenirs and food. To me its a bit overrated and i don't considerate a must see, but I'm glad i went just the same.",Tripadvisor
Seeing Mt Fuji close up is worth the trip. If you are going just to see Mt Fuji do not go to Hakone. The only place to see Mt Fuji is from the cable car and it is still a long ways away. Plus it takes foooor eeeever toooo geeeet anywhere. There are things to do and see in Hakone but for seeing Mt Fuji it was a bust and we considered it a wasted trip. It is better to go to Lake Kawaguchiko. Takes about the same amount of time but the view is so much better.The picture is from Lake Kawaguchiko.,Tripadvisor
"Even on the approach this castle stands out and as you get closer it even improves. The stairs are a challenge but if you take your time the view from the top is worth the effort.
Overcrowding is an issue however we were lucky enough to get there early and avoided the crush.
The grounds around the castle are vast and used for picnics, etc with many locals taking advantage of the blue sky when we visited.
One of the top attractions in Japan",Tripadvisor
"What an impressive mountain, and so beautiful it is not possible to capture that on a photo. We traveled through the Hakone national park and viewed the mountain from Oishi Park - what a sight. Surely this must be the most impressive sight in the whole of Japan. Must-see for anyone travelling to Japan.",Tripadvisor
"Himeji Castle is a top 5 attraction in Japan, and the experience starts from the train station. As you approach the castle, its majesty only get more impressive. I would argue the outside is far more interesting than the interior of the main keep: if you can't get in because of overcrowding, there's plenty to enjoy outside anyway.",Tripadvisor
Always thought it would be trite and touristic! But I was tremendously surprised. The mountain is majestic and visible for many miles.,Tripadvisor
Although not very high but It is a beautiful mountain. on our visit day sky was completely clear and we had very good view of the mountain. we went to 4th station only (because of heavy snow visit to 5th station was not allowed). we also had view of the Japanese Alps from there. A must visit place.,Tripadvisor

"Less than an hour by Shinkansen from Kyoto and walking distance from station, an ideal day trip.
Combo ticket for castle and beautiful gardens 1050 yen.
We visited at peak Cherry blossom time and the views from outside were just stunning.
Huge crowds and queues though , so much so that admission was suspended in the early afternoon, so get there early .
Once in the keep you can climb , shoeless obviously, 6 floors to the top in one continuous queue , but I wouldn’t bother as the views are the same from each floor and the really best views are from outside.",Tripadvisor
"A gorgeous castle with a very nice garden nearby. Perfect to take photos.
Highly recommended.
You will be asked (like in many other places to take your shoes off when entering the castle itself.
I was there in March so the trees were not blooming yet, I dare not imagine how pretty it is during spring or automn.",Tripadvisor
"A majestic castle that is absolutely worth going. But on one condition. U need to have a guide with you.
The good thing is that there is a volunteer group that offers free guides.

If you are planning to go to this castle please book an English speaking guide first.

You can google for it.

I chanced upon this resource just two days before my trip to Himeji. I was lucky that I got one on such late notice. Noboru-san was amazing in his knowledge.

I learnt so much from my guide, Noboru-san. The castle is filled with hidden attack points. The seemingly empty floors holds many secrets.",Tripadvisor
"Il castello è davvero imponente e domina sulla città . Consiglio sicuramente una visita ( uno dei pochi esemplere originali ) ma non posso fare a meno di dire che facendoti levare le scarpe per entrare, essendoci tantissimi scalini da fare (anche belli alti) purtroppo le caviglie ne risentono. Mettete calzini antiscivolo, io non lo sapevo avevo collant e non è stato piacevole!
Mostrando il biglietto fatto, nel negozio che si trova subito dopo l uscita del castello, c è la possibilità di avere degli sconti davvero buoni. Un ombrellino con la giapponesina costava più di 1000 yen e l ho acquistato a 300 yen",Tripadvisor
"Himeji is the largest castle in Japan that still has its original structure intact. The castle is located 2 bus stations away from Himeji JR train station. The bus only cost JPY 100 for a single trip. You can actually see the castle from the JR station and you could even walk there instead of taking a bus if you wish.

The main keep (castle) has 6 floors. You can explore the inside by climbing multiple narrow stairs. If you are not into climbing stairs, no worries, because there are no noteworthy displays and photo spots in it. Best pictures are taken outside of the castle.",Tripadvisor

"Me gusto mucho el castillo exteriormente, además estaba prácticamente vacío cuando fuimos. Sin embargo, de haber sabido que la visita dentro del castillo se puede resumir literalmente en salas completamente vacías y sólo subir y bajar las escaleras piso a piso no lo hubiera pagado. Si no recuerdo mal pagamos cada uno 1.050 yenes (1.000 yenes por el castillo y 50 yenes por un jardín que está al lado). Solo el castillo serian 1000 yenes. Y debo decir que los 50 yenes que costó el Jardín de la entrada combinada mereció muchísimo mas la pena que el propio interior del castillo, además con el Momiji estaba precioso el jardín. El castillo no lo recomendaría visitar sobre todo cuando se vuelvan a formar las colas que en temporada alta se formaban.",Tripadvisor

"Die Burg von Himeji sieht schon toll aus mit dem strahlenden Weiß und der interessanten Architektur.
Eine Besichtigung von außen lohnt sich auf jeden Fall.

Wenn man allerdings hoch in den Turm gelangen möchte, braucht man viel Geduld und Zeit. Es ist sehr voll, eng und teilweise sehr steil. Zu sehen gibt es darin nicht allzu viel - deshalb sollte man sich die Innen-Besichtigung überlegen - kann man machen, man verpasst aber auch nicht übermäßig viel, wenn man es lässt.",Tripadvisor
Himeji Castle was the first in Japan to be registered as a UNESCO Cultural World Heritage in 1993 as well as designated as a National Treasure in 1951. Also known as White Heron castle.

PS: Vielleicht war es eine nicht so gute Idee, vor den Burgkomplex eine Ausstellungshalle zu ""klatschen"".",Tripadvisor
Take pictures from the outside and turn back - visit the adjacent Japanese gardens (Koko-En) instead. The castle is an incredible piece of architecture but it’s literally empty - loads of narrow steep staircases to nothingness. Great potential but they’re missing a trick here - put a proper exhibition on. It’s a real pity. Not sure it’s worth a stop. We were lucky that it weren’t busy during our visit as some reviews suggest. PS. PLEASE replace the plastic bags you hand out to each visitor to carry their shoes with paper bags or something sustainable - literally every visitor contributes one plastic bag to waste!! Urgh!,Tripadvisor
"Having seen in in the James bond films I really wanted to vist this place, I worth a trip to it. As you walk from the station you find the road leads straight up to it. It a slight incline going up there which get steaper the closer you get to the castle. if you tall say over 6 feet you will need to duck under some of the beams and may find like I did you need to lean sideways to get under down the stairs. Great views from the top as you can see from the photos provided.",Tripadvisor
白漆喰総塗籠造りの白い城壁は厚化粧と思っていたが、まったくそんなことはなく、軽快な印象の中に落ち着いた重厚感がある。五重の大天守と東、西、乾の小天守が渡櫓で連結された連立式天守がまたいい。日本の城郭建築技術が最高潮に達した時期の最も完成された城といわれているが、さすが国宝&世界文化遺産、いろいろ城を見てきたけど、規模といい優美な姿といい圧巻！オーディオガイド（音声ガイド）松平健バージョンの解説を聞きながら城内を巡った。,Tripadvisor
"We only had 3 hours to visit the Himeji castle and the Koko-en garden, so it was very useful to have a volunteer guide (a former teacher) in the castle to guide us through and point out the details - highly recommended.
We then visited the near Koko-en garden (you can buy a combined ticket for the castle and the garden), where they had an exhibition of bonsai flowering azaleas - very impressive. The garden, which is divided into several themed smaller gardens, is also wonderful and a must to visit.
Plan 3 hours for the castle + 1,5 hours for the garden (without stoping for a tea or lunch in the tea house).",Tripadvisor
"This enormous, gorgeous castle with sprawling grounds is definitely worth a visit. Plan to stay at least a couple of hours. A few things to help enhance the experience: (1) English-language tour (currently twice a day, limited to 10 people, and is worth scheduling around - times available on the website). The castle and the grounds are immense and not super well signposted; it was super helpful to have someone just tell you what to look for and where to look, but there was much more to it. If you miss the tour, at least read up on the castle beforehand, or you won't appreciate its grandeur nearly as much. (2) the gardens are outside the main grounds, but also worth a visit, if you have the energy (3) you'll have to take your shoes off inside the structure, and there are a lot of steps to climb in slippery socks (bring non-slip socks, if that's an issue for you) (4) it's a straight 15 min walk or a nice quick taxi ride to the train station (5) for the fans of Hello Kitty: Himeji is one of the stops on the route of the Hello Kitty Shinkansen (we took a 15 min shinkansen from Kyoto to Osaka and hopped onto Hello Kitty from there; then took a direct shinkansen back to Kyoto, all covered by our Jrail pass).",Tripadvisor
"Sixty kilometers after Kobe, we reach the city of Himeji. Himeji Castle is one of the largest and most beautiful castles in Japan that was never destroyed by war, earthquake or fire. This building has been registered in the UNESCO World Heritage List and has the title of the best and most beautiful samurai castle in Japan. The entrance fee is 1000 yen and it takes two hours to visit.
Himeji Castle is known as White Egret because of its white color. The building dates back to the 15th century, although it was completed in 1609. To get to the castle, you have to go through the ticket office first and then take a winding path to reach the castle. This castle is built on 6 floors. The floors are connected by wooden stairs, and as we go to higher floors, its width decreases. Currently, the floors are empty and visitors can watch the view of the city and the castle courtyard from the windows of each floor. The moat around the castle is huge and a good place to take a boat tour (especially during cherry blossom season).",Tripadvisor
"We stopped at Himeji on the way from Kyoto to Hiroshima and it was about a 15 min walk from the train station to the castle. The exterior of the castle is quite stunning. If you visit the main keep, while the inside of the castle is reasonably interesting there’s little in the way of displays offering information so not much to look at. The main keep is six stories high and the stairs to the top get progressively steeper and narrower as you go, you need to be fairly mobile and active to go to the top. I’m reasonably active but not a huge fan of narrow steep steps so bailed out at the fourth floor although the husband carried on to the top. You’ll also need to take your shoes off and carry them in a carrier bag that you’re given after about the second floor.",Tripadvisor
"It's easy to get to Mount Fuji by bus from Tokyo.
The express highway bus terminal is located at Level 4 of the Shinjuku Bus Terminal. It is advisable to book your (return) ticket at least one day ahead to be sure of your desired timings. The two hour ride gets you to Lake Kawaguchi.

Upon reaching, a fifteen minute walk will lead you to Lake Kawaguchi. This would be the most ideal viewpoint of Mount Fuji.

Walk around the lake and the bridge which spans over the lake. The views are amazing.

Follow up by doing the ropeway. This is basically a cable-car which takes you to a stunning viewpoint of Mount Fuji. It is advisable to get your queue number first, go for a meal and get back for your number to be called. (wait time can be up to fifty minutes).

There is a local bus which can take you back to the station, should you choose not to walk. (both ways)
Alternatively, you can also rent bicycles from across the station from rental shops to cycle around the lakes.

"On a recent golf trip to Kobe, l took a day off from the tight golf schedule to relax. I spent the day with the non golfers in the group.
We set out at 8.30am from Oriental Hotel. Went by JR. Cost ¥990 one way. Got out of JR at 9.40am. Shuttle bus to main entrance ¥100.
Started the climb at 10.20am. Took 40min to go up to L6 but 10min to come down. Took a rest at 11.10am at base.
We then head towards Koko-En Gardens,just next to the Castle.
Himeji Castle is a UNESCO World heritage site. Built in the 17th century. The architecture built on timble is just amazing.
Not recommended for those not physically fit as the climb up to the highest point at L6 is exhausting to say the least.",Tripadvisor
"Awesome is actually an understatement. If you admired the sacred mountain in the pictures, you will be mesmerized once you see it personally. And I agree with what others say: it's better to view it from afar than to climb it. Besides, I'm not keen on mountain climbing, anyway. So, I'm kind of bias against conquering it.",Tripadvisor

"I climbed Fuji in August entirely on my own. Took subways and buses to trailhead and just started up one evening about 1800. Lots of other hikers, school kids love to practice English as they walk. We had a clear, beautiful sunrise. Arrived at top about 0330, and waited for sun. Very cold at 12,000 feet, so dress accordingly. The hike is not difficult, as the 80 year old ladies you see hiking it will tell you. It is just long, but anyone in moderate condition can do it. If you are fortunate enough to be in Japan in July or August, do it. I actually did this hike in August of 2012.",Tripadvisor

"One of the most special castles in the world, not just japan. Get a guide, as there are so many, many stories you want to hear and features you want to learn about. As a place built to survive any attack, it is special how all the defenses were built in. There are different ones across the eight floors. Be warned that theee is no heating in the castle itself, and you will walk barefeet, so dress warm.",Tripadvisor
"We stopped at Himeji on our trip from Hiroshima to Fuji . This castle is a must see in Japan . Sadly we only had 4 hours available to do this stop , which was barely enough .

On hindsight we should have stayed one night at Himeji and enjoyed it at a slower pace . We had large suitcases with us but luckily there are lockers at the station where you can store your luggage for about £4 per locker for the day. The castle is a 15 min walk from Himeji station .

The castle is absolutely stunning and can be seen from the station . It was a sunny day - which made it look like a postcard . As it was a Monday after all the public holidays - it was nice and quite and not too many tourists so no queues!

The castle is built on different levels and has some 6 floors . So there are a lot of steps - some quite narrow . The cost for the castle and gardens was £6 per ticket.

We didn’t go all the way up the 6 floors but still enjoyed the entire experience. There are plenty of signs explaining the history etc in English and there are free guides available who speak English . We heard they are very good but we didn’t take one as we only had limited time . There are some fantastic photo opportunities and we spent just over 2 hours at the castle . If you want to explore every single floor and read all the signs you will need a lot longer. The inside of the castle is fairy simple - with various exhibits . It’s all very clean with lovely wooden floors - you are expected to take your shoes off.

The castle gardens are also a must see . They are a 5 min walk outside the castle - very beautiful with lovely trees , ponds , flowers , fish etc . We spent just over hour here. It would have been nice to sit there and just take in the scenery.
There is also a restaurant inside the gardens which looked nice but we didn’t go in.

Compared to the castle at Osaka ( which is also lovely) - Himeji castle is more amazing - a lot higher and bigger , the complex inside the walls has many buildings within it. Great architecture and history . Though It’s easier to walk around outside the Castle at Osaka without needing to go in - for us Himeji was a very special experience and should not be missed.",Tripadvisor
"A must-see! This incredible castle is gorgeous from the outside, and the walk-through on the inside gives you an appreciation for medieval Japanese architecture, some historical facts, and also incredible views of the surroundings of Himeji and the mountains from the top!

"Impressive castle. I would highly recommend it.
We were planning to go to Horishima on a day's trip and added a stop to the HImeji castle on our way there. Probably the best castle we visited in Japan.

"白漆喰の城壁が、まるで白鷺のような美しさを称えていながら、遠くからでも良く分かる荘厳さと実用的な堅牢さを兼ね備え、しかもそれが400年以上もの間ほとんど姿を変えていない。これだけの建築仕様は世界を見渡しても類を見ない。奈良の『法隆寺地域の仏教建造物』と共に、1993年に制定された日本で最初の世界文化遺産の1つであり、現存天守の1つでもある。
幾度となく修復作業が行われているものの、現存天守を未来にも伝え続けることを目的の一つとしているため、城内には、エスカレーター・エレベーターは勿論、照明器具やエアコンすらも一切ない。但し、昇降するための階段があまりに急であるため、足を滑らせて落ちないように可搬式の照明器具が設置されている。外からの光を取り入れているものの、それでも城内は薄暗い。夏季は、城内の薄暗さと扇風機を導入しているため比較的涼しいが、冬季は非常に寒く感じるだろう。土足での入城は厳禁で、入口で靴を脱ぐ必要がある（専用の下駄箱があり、必要に応じて靴入れの袋の貸し出しもある）。スリッパのレンタルはしなくても大丈夫だが、特に冬季の板張りの床の冷たさを考慮すると、スリッパはレンタルした方がいい。
前述の通り照明やエアコンすら設置されていないが、文化財を火災から守るためのスプリンクラーが設置されている。このスプリンクラーは極めて感度がよく、カメラのフラッシュが焚かれただけでも水が撒かれる程の感度である。城内は、ほとんどの箇所で写真撮影が可能だが、フラッシュは絶対に使用してはいけない（文化財保護のため、三脚や自撮り棒も使用が禁止されている）。
展示物の数も非常に少ないため、博物館のように城内を周遊することを期待する人には物足りないと感じるかもしれない。この城はどちらかと言えば、400年という時を経て今に伝わる姫路城の建築様式を見て学ぶための場所、と思った方がいいだろう。必要に応じてガイドのツアーに参加した方がより楽しめると思う（ガイドは姫路市内在住のボランティアだが、日本語は勿論英語も堪能である）。
前述の通りエスカレーター・エレベーターは無く、今後も設置されることはないため、車椅子等の障碍を持つ方の利用はお勧めできない。しかし、城外の敷地の周遊・見学であれば、介助者を随行させることが出来る。

The white stucco walls of its castle, while celebrating a beauty like an egret, are both majestic and practically robust, clearly visible even from a distance. Moreover, it has remained virtually unchanged for more than 400 years. This level of architectural specification is unparalleled anywhere in the world. Together with ""Buddhist Monuments in the Horyu-ji Area"" in Nara, it's one of the first World Heritage sites in Japan established in 1993, and is also one of the only existing castle keepers in Japan.
Although restoration work has been done many times, there are no escalators, elevators, lighting fixtures, or even air conditioners in the castle, as one of the objectives is to keep the existing castle tower intact into the future. However, the stairs to ascend and descend are so steep that portable lighting fixtures have been installed to prevent visitors from slipping and falling. Although the castle is lit from the outside, it's dimly lit. During the summer, it's relatively cool because of the dimness of the castle and the installation of fans, but during the winter, it will feel very cold. Entering the castle with shoes on is strictly prohibited, and shoes must be removed at the entrance (there is a special shoe box, and shoe bags are available for rent if necessary). You do not need to rent slippers, but considering the coldness of the wooden floor, especially in winter, it's better to rent slippers.
As mentioned above, there is no lighting or even air conditioning, but sprinklers have been installed to protect the cultural property from fire. These sprinklers are extremely sensitive, so sensitive that even a camera flash will spray water. Photography is allowed in most parts of the castle, but flash photography is strictly prohibited (tripods and selfie sticks are also prohibited for the protection of cultural properties).
The number of exhibits is very small, so those who expect to tour the castle like a museum may find it lacking. It is better to think of the castle as a place to see and learn about the architectural style of Himeji Castle, which has been passed down through 400 years of history. It would be more enjoyable to take a guided tour if necessary (the guides are volunteers living in Himeji, but they are fluent in English as well as Japanese).
As mentioned above, there are no escalators or elevators, and none will be installed in the future, so wheelchairs and other disabilities are not recommended. However, a caregiver can accompany visitors on a tour of the grounds outside the castle.",Tripadvisor

"I was slightly hesitant about going inside after seeing negative reviews about it, but am so glad we did. There are queues, the stairs are narrow and wooden and a bit slippery so you need good socks, but it's lovely! Very atmospheric, lovely smells of the old wood and a stunning view from the top. It's also nice and cool inside when there's a breeze as all the windows are open. We had 3 kids and grandma with us and everyone loved it. Even the 14 yr old said it was the best castle he'd visited.",Tripadvisor
"Himeji is a really beautiful castle with very nice grounds to walk around. On the day we went it was extremely crowded, and if we'd known that the climb through to the top floor would take as long as it did, we probably wouldn't have done it. The inside isn't much to look at, it's very bare. The views from the top are good, but it was very crowded inside and the steep stairs made it difficult for a lot of people, so it took a very long time to get up and back.

Sadly there wasn't much cherry blossom when we were there but it was still worth the trip. The combined ticket with Koko-en garden is worth it - the entrance fee for the garden works out about 50p extra and it's a lovely site.",Tripadvisor

"Al descender del tren y salir de la estación, ya se puede apreciar la silueta del castillo.
Para llegar se puede ir caminando en 15 a 20 minutos, o por un bus, que es la opción de un pase diario en caso de querer recorrer la ciudad o un boleto único, que llega hasta la entrada del castillo.
Precio de la entrada 1000 yenes, combinado con los jardines KoKo contiguos 1050.
Desde el ingreso se aprecia la magnificencia de ""la garza blanca"" uno de los castillos más antiguos, mejor conservado. Patrimonio de la humanidad y Tesoro Nacional.
Rodeado de árboles ( en nuestro caso , repleto de cerezos en flor), se ingresa por la puerta Hishi , se suben 5/6 pisos por escalera de madera ( en realidad son 7 porque parte de un subsuelo). Desde hace unos años se ha desmantelado el interior, pero en la medida que se va subiendo, se aprecian las hermosas vistas y se disfrutan los pisos y techos en cada uno de los pisos, en especial los techos extreriors con las tejas y sus blasones.
Destacan al margen de las vistas, las ventanas pequeñas, especialmente diseñadas para disminuir las posibilidades de ingreso de proyectiles.
En resumen, una de las visitas imperdibles en el viaje a Japón.",Tripadvisor

"We went to Himeji Castle on a day-trip from Osaka and super glad that we did. The trip was easy to do by train as there are multiple trains every hour there and back. The castle was fantastic, the most picturesque we saw during our time in Japan. We were there at the peak of the cherry blossoms, which was incredible. Even with thousands of other visitors, it didn't seem like a crush because the grounds are huge, giving people opportunity to spread out.",Tripadvisor
"Es un lugar impresionante. Desde que te bajas del tren, lo divisas al fondo y ya impresiona. A medida que te acercas más.
Había leído que no merecía la pena porque estaba vació. Totalmente en desacuerdo.
En la zona lateral de los almacenes hay un montón de paneles con mucha información para que te ubiques en el contexto
Luego en el castillo no hay demasiadas cosas, en el sentido de muebles. La riqueza y lo que se debe resaltar es la estructura del castillo. En cada sala hay paneles dónde te resaltan los puntos a los que debes prestar atención.
Es increíble la estructura de madera y como los construyen, así como la cubierta del tejado.
Una maqueta del armazón me pareció muy interesante y un video sobre la forma en que se construyó también.
La visita recomienda 1:30 h yo pasé más de dos horas.
Siempre es mejor hacerlo con buen tiempo, pero si un día llueve puede ser una opción ya que estas a cubierto la mayoría del tiempo.",Tripadvisor
"This is a beautiful looking castle, great for photography. The grounds are well kept. The only drawback is the amount of stairs you have to climb once inside and some are very steep.

"Located 1km away from the JR Himeji train station and easily visible on the approach is this beautiful castle, towering above us sitting on stone walls. It was a nice path up to the entrance with various moats and walls on the way.
The interior of the main keep is set up as a one way path which helps manage the crowds especially on the stairs. It is mandatory to remove your shoes which means carrying them for the duration of the visit. The castle does provide recyclable bags to carry them in.
Inside was quite decorative with the use of heavy dark timbers and was incredibly sparse with no furniture or weapons on display. It was more about the building style. There were weapon racks and dropholes where projectiles could be thrown from. It was certainly a castle built for defence. It was built in the 17th C and had been completely renovated and rebuilt from scratch between 1930 to 1980. They used traditional techniques to re-build it. It was built on the site of a shrine that was relocated and they built another shrine on the top floor to avoid fears of a curse on the owners.
After the main keep there is a large courtyard giving the best photo opportunities.",Tripadvisor
"…due to (presumably) the desire to keep things as authentic as possible inside. This leaves the climb up the main keep strangely boring given there is such little on display to actually look at or read about. This is in stark contrast to other castles I have visited in Japan, which have loads to learn about inside the castle itself. And I don’t think those two things need to be mutually exclusive. Anyway, still pretty amazing to visit but could be improved.",Tripadvisor
"This visit was worth the short ride from Kyoto. It is a beautiful castle, with some information sprinkled along as you wind your way up to the top.",Tripadvisor
"Lovely castle to visit with it's stunning exterior and garden. There was a lot of climbing steps once inside - sometimes perilously steep - but with nothing really to look at other than bare rooms that looked all the same. The experience would be enhanced by a few more display cabinets showing perhaps the clothes they wore, food they ate etc. to make the visit more engaging",Tripadvisor

"人生2度目の富士山登頂は、想定以上に大変でした。体力が確実に落ちている。とほほ。
富士スバルライン5合目から、1泊2日の富士山初心者向け吉田ルートにて登頂しました。
同じルートではありますが、数十年前、学生の頃、皆で夜出発して翌日に下山という弾丸的なことをしたことがあったので、今回、7合目近くの山小屋で宿泊して1泊2日であれば、何とかなるだろうと思ってましたが、そうでもなかったでした。いやぁー本当に大変でした。しまいには、帰りのバスに間に合わず、5合目近くの山小屋にもう一泊することになってしまいました。「とほほ」でした。
で、数十年ぶりの2回目の富士登頂では、「こんなところよく若い頃登ったな」「あれ？こんな崖っぽいところを登ったかな？」などといろいろと当時のかすかな記憶を思い出しながら登山となり、それはそれで面白い経験でした。が、なにせ体力が続かない。本当にトホホ登山でした。
まぁー、それにしても今回は、私的にはいろいろありましたが、とりあえず、なんとか、頂上と言われる火口部分まで行け、無事に下山できたのは良かったでした。それが何よりですね。もちろん、雲海、美しい朝日も良かったでした。

"Just toured the Himeji Castle. We read the reviews and expected all the stairs and ladders. What we didn’t expect was there to be nothing to see. Nothing. Nada. Zero. We were ushered up stairs and ladders, floor by floor to see??? A view from the top? On the very top floor there was a small shrine with a bell to ring but that was pretty much it. Wooden floor after wooden floor, big empty spaces. There was a QR code on each level but we were ushered so fast there was no time to dowqqnload it. The guide from the app was helpful but we were really disappointed. The outside of the castle is beautiful and we really did like the Princess prayer building. It was very cool. But overall we’d skip the entire tour. Seriously, tour the Princess’ prayer building and maybe a couple of floors of the castle. Even the view at the top is through the small windows so not that great.",Tripadvisor

"Paisagem ícone do Japão, passeio imperdível! Deixo aqui algumas dicas que fizeram podem fazer a diferença para uma boa experiência:
Selecionar com a cidade base próxima ao Monte Fuji, ficamos em Kawaguchiko. A cidade tem uma vista privilegiada para o Monte Fuji, opções de restaurantes, e fácil acesso por trem (saímos de Tokyo - aproximadamente 2 horas de viagem);
Compre com antecedência as passagens de ida e volta, como é um destino concorrido você pode ter dificuldade de achar passagem de última hora (tentamos comprar passagem de ônibus e não conseguimos), e vimos pessoas que não conseguiram voltar para Tokyo por que os tickets tinham acabado.
Tempo: a visibilidade depende muito da previsão do tempo, em dias nublados você tem grande chance de não ver o monte em sua totalidade.
O que fazer: Panoramic Rope Way (subir de cable car e descer a pé pelas trilhas, Arakura Sengen Park (em Fujiyoshida).",Tripadvisor

"The Himeji Castle is situated on hilltop and is considered as the finest surviving example of prototypical Japanese castle architecture, comprising a network of rooms with advanced defensive systems from the feudal period. It is the largest and most visited castle in Japan, and it was registered in 1993 as one of the first UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Japan.

During our recent visit, it was raining heavily all day long from the time we arrived in Himeji. After waiting for quite a while, and nearing the closing operation hours, we decide to give up visiting the castle but just walk at the park in front of it and take photos of it.

The castle was indeed beautiful and awesome even from a distance with lightings when the street was filled with yellow leaves trees, adding to the vibes.

"Я очень пожалел, что не удосужился посетить одну из главных достопримечательностей Японии в свою первую поездку, поэтому заранее включил её в свой план на вторую. Удачным совпадением явилось то, что моя вторая поездка совпала с сезоном ""ханами"", цветением сакур. И будет нелишним сказать, что замок выглядел невероятно красиво на фоне сакур в полном цвету. Создавалась особая атмосфера. Единственное с чем мне повезло не очень, это с погодой. В день моего посещения шел дождь, хотя не скажу, что это сильно повлияло на моё впечатление от визита. В отличие от других замков, которые я видел в Японии, этот действительно был всем замкам замок. Большой, величавый, он гордо возвышался над одноименным городом. Также стоит упомянуть сразу несколько уникальных канализационных люков, изображавших белых цапель и замок. Я прошёл от станции до замка пешком, но насколько я знаю до него также ходят автобусы или можно взять такси. Итого: всем искренне рекомендую. Туда можно относительно быстро доехать от Осаки или Киото.",Tripadvisor

We were fortunate to have a wonderful knowledgeable guide with us which truly enhanced our visit. The walk to the keep is quite taxing up multiple very narrow steep stairs. The views at the top are great but it’s not a deal breaker if you don’t go up. Seeing the castle from the grounds is the best bit.,Tripadvisor

"Questo si che è un castello!
Tutta l'anima del Giappone in questa meraviglia
L'interno, assolutamente da visitare, in legno, antico, con scale ripide che portano fino alla cima.
Niente a che vedere con quello di Osaka che è stato trasformato in un museo moderno con tanto di ascensori.
Vale assolutamente la visita, a circa un'ora da Kyoto con Schinkansen.",Tripadvisor
"One of the highlights in our Japan tour. Absolutely stunning grounds and most stunning castle in Japan.
The tickets paid for were affordable. Immediately as you enter there were vending machines for drinks. This place is just absolutely exquisite if you time it right with the weather.
Prepare yourself for a walk with this one.
The toilets and comfort facilities were very clean and accessible.
Highly recommend the place.",Tripadvisor
"Hermoso castillo que impresiona desde afuera
Desde adentro si bien no tiene mucha cosas creo que realmente al mantenerse original vale muchísimo la pena recorrerlo",Tripadvisor
"Himeji Castle, a Japan national treasure, is the most visited castle in Japan. It is definitely a must go for anyone visiting the Kansai area. It looks so beautiful with its well maintained white plaster walls from afar. There are 6 storeys of narrow and steep wooden stairs made accessible to visitors. It is interesting to learn about the castle history of the ruling classes of the feudal period. We were here on 4 April 2024, the peak of the Sakura blooming. It is such a privilege to admire the 1000 cherry trees with full blossom with the beautiful castle as the backdrop.",Tripadvisor

"Himeji castle is magnificent to look and is worth a visit just for that. magnificent. however, i advise don't bother going inside the keep unless you go at opening time and are agile. So many people. You queue up for a long time. Oldies are at serious risk of injury. Once inside you take your shoes off, which can be slippery on the polished floors and you have to climb many flights of extremely steep and narrow stairs. You are herded like cattle to market and pushed quickly along up each flight of stairs, non stop. you barely have a chance to breathe and look at the dark empty interior. Once at the top. Nothing. Then, you are pushed out quickly to leave. So, don't waste your time, especially if it is limited. It can be far better used. Castle exterior five stars, Internal experience zero stars.",Tripadvisor
"There castle was as pictured, it looked majestic and so easy to imagine how the people who used to occupy the area lived around the Edo period. You need to remove shoes when you go in which was not ideal during winter as the floors are cold. I paid for the castle and the gardens, however was not able to visit the garden as there was no clear directions on how to reach it.",Tripadvisor
We took the train from Osaka to visit himeji castle early in the morning. We arrived at opening and it was really something spectacular. The whole castle is maintained with the original interior. It is a huge site with some amazing views inside and outside. This really is a must-see!,Tripadvisor
"Worth the hype. One of the best day trips you can make out of Osaka. If you make it early enough, make sure to avail the free English tour from one of the guides near the entrance. Our guide, Takumi-san was great and made sure to educate us on the castle itself during the tour.",Tripadvisor
"I really enjoyed seeing Himeji castle and it was made especially worthwhile by my brilliant tour guide, Hidekazu Fujioka who was so knowledgeable about the castle’s architecture and history. Without this, I don’t think I would’ve gained much knowledge about the castle as there is little information onsite. This tour was free and available from the entrance of the castle - I’d highly highly recommend it!",Tripadvisor
Bella esperienza in uno dei templi più emblematici e conosciuti di Kyoto e di tutto il Giappone in genere. Adatto anche a bambini,Tripadvisor
"Ascension réalisée de jour. Départ de Kawaguchiko par le bus de 6h30 et arrivée à la 5eme station à 7h30. Achat d'un petit bâton à faire graver tout au long de l'ascension puis départ. La première partie jusqu'à la 6eme station est assez roulante. De la 6eme station on peut voir les autres stations qui nous attendent ainsi que le sommet. C'est à la fois motivant et à la fois un peu effrayant. Entre la 6eme et 7eme station on monte des lacets sur un chemin en bon état. À partir de la 7eme station les choses se compliquent. On est sur des roches, il faut des fois poser des mains pour ""escalader"", c'est beaucoup plus fatiguant. De nombreux endroits pour s'arrêter et se reposer (et faire un tampon sur son bâton). Possibilité d'acheter à boire et/ou à manger.
Le chemin jusqu'à la 8eme station se fait bien. A la 8eme station on est à plus de 3000m et le souffle se fait plus court. A la 8,5 station il reste 300m pour la 9eme et 600m pour le sommet. Et c'est long. Besoin de beaucoup d'arrêts pour respirer. Les gens autour de moi font pareil. Mais le sommet est en vue et chaque pas nous en rapproche. Puis enfin, on arrive au sommet du Mont Fuji est c'est magnifique. Possibilité de faire le tour du cratère. Ensuite vient la descente. Prévoir si possible des bâtons (certains hôtels en fournissent) car ce sont des petits cailloux très glissant. Descente monotone et extrêmement longue.
5h de montée, 2h de descente avec vues magnifiques sur toute la vallée. Grand soleil ce jour là mais la chaleur n'était pas insupportable. Je ne suis pas une grande marcheuse mais j'ai l'habitude des sentiers à la Réunion et je n'ai pas trouvé celui extrêmement difficile (a refaire !). Pas besoin de chaussures de randonnées spéciales, prévoir de l'eau, des vêtements chauds/ de pluie, de l'eau et à manger. Casquette et crème solaire pour ne pas cramer et penser à s'hydrater régulièrement ! Enjoy !Ça vaut le coup !",Tripadvisor
"Amazing Castle with a rich history. It has a unique Japanese construction and is perfectly preserved. There could be more artefacts on display, particularly Samurai weaponry, but the building itself, which dominates the skyline around it, was breathtaking. there are some beautiful gardens nearby called Koko. We were at the wrong time of year to see them in their full glory, but worthwhile.",Tripadvisor
"We really enjoyed our tour around Himeji Castle. There were a lot of steps and steep paths, but it was worth it.
Also very hot as we went in a warm September. But the guide waS lovely and there is a machine for buying water. Also need to take your shoes off to enter so take socks if you don't want to be bare foot",Tripadvisor

11月下旬紅葉のピークの週末だったのでお城の周辺はたくさんの人で賑わっていました。隣の庭園（好古園）は入場待ちの行列ができていました。城内かかなり広いですので、人混みが気になるようなことはなく、紅葉を楽しむことができました。桜の頃もいいですが、秋の姫路城もきれいでした。,Tripadvisor
3年ぶりの来所です。前回はお色直し直後でしたが、まだ一部の櫓が修復中で真っ白な全景を写真で収められたのは初めてです。訪問時間が夕刻だったので外から全景を眺めながら広場を一周して帰りました。土曜日と全国旅行支援が再開したばかりと言うこともありかなりの観光客で賑わっていました。また、外国人の方も大勢いらしてましたね。,Tripadvisor
姫路城とお城の周辺を散策しました。大変広く立派なお城で内部もゆっくりと見学できました。天守閣から一望できる景色も美しかったです。日本各地のお城を見学してきましたが、見ごたえのある素晴らしいお城でした。,Tripadvisor
JR姫路駅を出ると正面に見える姫路城は、この街のシンボルとして、皆様に愛されているのだと感じました。白さとスケール感は、やはり圧巻です。残念ながら仕事での姫路訪問でしたので、宿泊時の早朝散歩時に周辺を歩かせて頂きました。大変キレイに管理された公園や駐車場が周囲にあり、素晴らしいと思いました。出来れば昼間にゆっくり散策したいです。,Tripadvisor
華やかで雄大なお城。個人的に西の丸庭園から見る姿が好み。2013年のリニューアル直後の白さは無くなっていたのが残念。,Tripadvisor
"JR姫路駅前からの写真をアップしておきます。
姫路駅までいって、ぜひお城に登るべきだと思いますが、時間がない時にJR姫路駅で降りても、駅からビルの合間にお城が見えます。",Tripadvisor
姫路城には一度で良いら行ってみたかった場所で天守閣の内部も見ることが出来て良かったです。外から眺めているだけでも美しく大きいなお城です。姫路公園で座って暫く眺めていても飽きないと思います。姫路駅からお城まで10分位歩きますが歩道も広く歩きやすかったです。,Tripadvisor
日本全国のお城を巡っていますが、姫路城は私が1番好きなお城です。何度行っても飽きません。大天守内に入るためには16時までに入場する必要がありますが、姫路公園には24時間入ることができるので、いつでも間近で見ることができます。今回姫路に22時に到着したため、夜の姫路城を楽しみました。姫路城は深夜0時まで360°ライトアップされているので、ライトアップされている姫路城の周囲を１周しました。どの角度から見ても美しいです。外観を見るだけなら、昼間よりも夜間の方が見応えがあります。,Tripadvisor
ずっと行きたかったんですが、今回姫路に宿泊したので夕方行ってみました。姫路駅からお城が見えるので迷うことはないです。10分くらい歩いたら着きました。遠くから見てもキレイです。真夏の夕方で犬の散歩の方、ジョギングの方、ウオーキングの方、たくさんいました。ずっとお城の外周を回りましたがいい運動になりました。駅の至近にこれだけの建造物があるとはすごいことです。,Tripadvisor
久しぶりに天守閣に入場しました。場内のいろんな角度から、近くややや遠くから天守閣を眺めることができたのは良かったです。天守閣の内部は特に何もなく、改修前に登った時と変化なしでした。炎天下では天守閣は登らずに眺めるに限るかもしれまっせん。,Tripadvisor
"At first look Himeji Castle is a big empty building but with the right information it is a cultural, architectural, and historical wonder. We were fortunate to see it with few if any crowds. We were even more fortunate to chance upon a tour guide from VeGA, the Volunteer Guide Association of Himeji Castle. Ito-san approached us and at first I thought it was a scam. I then remembered I was in Japan and they just don't do that. Look for the blue armband near the ticket window. Because I know about Japanese and castle history, and we had plenty of time, she gave us a three hour tour for free. In flawless English no less. They tailor the tour to the person so if I had only a little time or really didn't know much, it would have gone much quicker.

Our tour was, by far, one of the best tours I have ever received at any historical site ever. I appreciate that she took to talk to us and we never felt rushed. She tailored the tour to my knowledge level. I could see that she was pleasantly surprised at my level of knowledge regarding castles, Japan, Japanese history, and the film You Only Live Twice. She was an excellent ambassador for her city and the nation of Japan.

The Volunteer Guide Association of Himeji Castle (VEGA) is an amazing resource for people to understand and connect with Himeji-jo and the city of Himeji. As a visitor to their country, I appreciate that locals would volunteer their time, on their days off, to provide instruction and insights into one of Japan's twelve remaining original castles. VEGA is a valuable asset to the castle itself, the city of Himeji, and the nation of Japan. What is more, they provide these tours not only to other Japanese but, in nearly flawless English, to foreign visitors as well. My wife and I will be forever grateful to VEGA for such a memorable day.",Tripadvisor
姫路へ立ち寄る機会がありましたので、世界遺産でもあり国宝でもある姫路城へ初めて行ってみました。写真では何度か見たことがありましたが、実際に見ると、その美しさに圧倒されました。,Tripadvisor
"This is also known as the White Heron Castle and considered Japan's most spectacular. It comprises 83 buildings and dates from the Shogun period. I personally found this my favourite castle. It is impressive, elegant and unique especially the six story wooden structure. The open field is great for photo opportunities. If you visit the main building, there are steep stairs ascending the floors which are mostly unfurnished and only a few have displays. We visited right at the beginning of Covid in March 2020 so there were very few tourists. From Himeji station, it is about 15 mins walk. Do not miss this when visiting Japan.",Tripadvisor

世界文化遺産であり、国宝でもある姫路城。その白さから白鷺城とも呼ばれています。実際にこの目で見て、その美しさと大きさに圧倒されます。また、ボランティアの方が非常に多かったことも印象に残っています。地元の方たちが、姫路城を「姫路のシンボル」として大切に守ってきたことが良く分かりました。,Tripadvisor
白を基調とした素晴らしく美しいお城です。天守だけでなく、西の丸や庭園も合わせてみたいところです。姫路駅からは徒歩圏内、15分くらいですかね。美しい過ぎて戦の砦という感じはなく、殿様の宮殿という感じなのが城として見たときには弱点かもしれません、,Tripadvisor
誇らしい地元のお城です。何度も登りましたが毎回楽しめます。内部は当時のものを見ることができ変に現代の手が加わっていません。階段が割と急斜面ですが当時のままを感じることができ貴重な体験ができます。基本自然光で照明も必要最低限ですがそれがお城の当たり前です。説明が少ないという人もいますがとても有名なお城ですしアプリ案内もあるので変に看板がないほうが私は好きです。これからも歴史を伝えるお城として多少不便でも変に現代風に改修することなく当時の状態を保っていただけると嬉しいです。,Tripadvisor
年末の姫路城。ライトアップで白さが際立って綺麗でした。姫路駅から徒歩で寒い中行って撮影。2021年、12月30日。休館日でしたがライトアップされてたので、近くまで行って正解‼️,Tripadvisor
"If you are into the stereotypical tourist spots this is not the place to visit. However, if you are fluent in Japanese or have a special interest in history, this is the place. Very well-kept and easy to access.
You have to remove your shows while inside, so you may want to bring an extra pair of socks if you come over during winter.
The park is nice, and they offer a combo ticket to visit some gardens.

"L'ascension du Mont Fuji est juste exceptionnelle. Nous avons fait l'ascension en juillet 2019 par la voie la plus longue et difficile qui commence à 1200m d'altitude et très très peu fréquentée par les touristes, pratiquement que par des japonais (nous avons croisé un couple de Canadien). Le calme, la vue magnifique, la zénitude, c’était juste magique, pratiquement seul avec dès fois quelques japonais. Nous avons dormi dans le refuge Miharashi-kan à 3300m d'altitude, une bonne ambiance conviviale.
Bref, j'ai hâte de le refaire une seconde fois!",Tripadvisor
Great place to visit. Would recommend you get there early as the place was very crowded. However if you walk up the hill for about 10-15 mins the crowds thin out and it all becomes much more pleasant.,Tripadvisor
"夏のシーズンに初めて訪れました。とても暑かったですが、夏だからこその美しい眺めを堪能できて良かったなと思います。水路を流れる水の音が気持ち良く、水がとてもキレイで、山々や稲など自然豊かな場所でした。集落全体はとても広いので、見学の時間には余裕が必要です。

集落では飲食店や売店、民宿、博物館など多様な建物があります。重要文化財に指定されている和田家、神田家、長瀬家では歴史ある史料の展示があり、2階や3階に上がると眺めの良い景色が見えます。全て見学する必要は無いかと思いますが、最低一つは見学することを推奨します。また写真撮影では何処を切り取ってもステキな絵になり、自分好みのスポットや角度探しをしながら撮影するのも楽しかったなと思います。

荻町城跡の展望台に行くと集落全体を見渡せ、集落全体の写真を撮ることが可能です。ここからの眺めは一見の価値ありで、来て良かったなと思える眺めでした☆また城山天守閣の展望台にはカフェがあり、休憩も可能でした。展望台までは有料シャトルバスが運行されていますが、20分間隔の運転であり、人が多くて乗車できなかったため徒歩で上りました。

また「合掌造り民家園」と行き来する「であい橋」では大きな庄川を眺めることができ、これも良い眺めで印象に残りました。但しこの橋は結構揺れるので、そのスリリングも楽しめました(^_^;)

また白川郷までのアクセスについて。高山や金沢などからバスが運行されているため、足がなくても訪れやすいなと感じました。",Tripadvisor
"Já estive lá na primavera e no outono e, realmente gostei muito de visitar nessas épocas. O verão não combina muito com esta vila, mas que mesmo assim não perde seu encanto. O mais estranho foi a baixa frequencia, tão diferente das epocas citadas. Várias lojas fechadas e até alguma dificuldade de encontrar restaurantes abertos. Revisitamos o interior de uma dessas casas ""Gassho Style"" e nos surpreendemos pois desta vez foi nos apresentado uma sala de orações muito bonita com altar e tudo. Muito legal.
Tem um museu no local mas que não visitamos destas vez.",Tripadvisor
"Nos encantó este pueblo, sin duda un imprescindible si estas en Japón. El pueblo está compuesto por pequeñas casas tradicionales con una estética mágica e incluso algunas están abiertas para su visita. Merece la pena pasear por sus calles, caminar cerca de los pequeños canales con truchas y admirar sus florecitas cuidadas al milímetro. Aunque el día estuvo lluvioso, la visita es espectacular, recomendable 100%.",Tripadvisor
"A ne pas manquer si vous êtes de passage à Kyoto....mais dès le matin déjà beaucoup de monde pour monter ""au ciel"" des toris.....compter 3 heures A/R pour faire le parcours en totalité. Plus vous montez ,moins il y a de monde.C'est accessible sauf petite condition physique ou problème de genoux ou pied....beaucoup d'escaliers et les derniers sont raides.Donc une visite à faire en douceurs dans une fourmilière. Accès direct avec le JR Inari.",Tripadvisor
初めてうかがいました。ありがとうございました。ただ、平日にも関わらず、行きの電車、そして千本鳥居はマジに大渋滞でした。もっとゆっくり見てまわりたかったのですが、仕方ないですね。,Tripadvisor
This was a very impressive and mesmerizing attraction to visit and it was quite the walk too! The only reason I didn’t give this a five star review is because it’s literally almost never as empty as people want you to believe. So crowded that it’s nearly impossible to take photo without a crowd of random people in your photo!,Tripadvisor
Went here for hiking in the morning. Really enjoy the structures and location that showcase the beauty of nature,Tripadvisor
"Visited May 2023. Had high hopes... we waited about 20 minutes for car parking. I am not sure why they were limiting cars coming in as the car park was only about 25% full. There were a lot of coaches though so perhaps they were limiting numbers in the village.

Parking is not crazy expensive its 1000 yen. We crossed the bridge over the river and went into the village and started to have a look around. Its pretty dont get me wrong, but its mostly rice fields and of course the houses.

Within 5 minutes I was stood on a small bridge and looked down and at my feet about 6 inches away was a massive snake, about 6 or 7 feet and about 3 inches thick.

Ok, just back away.... I have a pretty bad phobia so it was really not a good start but we carried on, was probably a one off, right?

Ten minutes later another crawls out right in front of me at my feet. Turn round to go back and another on the path!

If there had just been signs I would have not gone in. Or at least been ready.

I know Japan has snakes but that many in such a small place there really should be signs. Took me a few days to get over it.",Tripadvisor
"C’est un village sensationnel avec toutes ces maisons en toit de chaumes très épais. Nous étions chanceux car contrairement à d’autres, il n’y avait pas encore trop de touristes.",Tripadvisor
"What an expensive waste of time! The bus fare is exorbitant for a 50 minute trip (¥52,000 per person, def a tourist rip-off) and when you get there there are a number of thatched houses, some pretty bulbs and that’s it other than the shops. Half an hour and you’re ready to leave again.",Tripadvisor
"Dovendo scegliere tra gli innumerevoli templi a Kyoto, questo rappresenta uno dei più caratteristici, di quelli che si vedono in tv, su Instagram, e le numerose porte rosse consentono una visita rara, anche se la stessa sequenza di porte rosse la su può ritrovare in molti altri templi meno gettonati, a garanzia di foto più suggestive. Questo tempio è invaso di turisti, ma è molto grande e gran parte delle persone rinuncia ad arrivare alla vetta, quindi per foto senza persone è consigliabile armarsi di scarpe comode e andare direttamente all’apice del tempio, ne vale la pena.",Tripadvisor
"I remember seeing this village on YouTube with NHK, I was absolutely gob smacked to see such a beautiful place still existed in this day and age, there aren’t many places of history left that are still inhabited like Shirakawa go.",Tripadvisor
"Esta hermoso y vale la pena ir solo que recuerda que es un lugar muy concurrido.

"Ko, our Kyoto driver/guide, took us here in 2017 when we were here. We re-visited it, calling it ""10,000 Torii,"" although we don't know exactly how many torii there are. The reason being that newly added ones are donated and built all the time. Ko said that he hopes one day to have a small one erected for himself. It will have inscriptions of his choosing. He is building up his savings to eventually do this. I hope he tells us when it is done.",Tripadvisor

雪景彷彿童話世界，從過橋就是一個新的世界及轉場。山、雪及天空的漸層色，讓視覺處於享受的狀態。天氣好時，搭巴士（1人¥200)至瞭望台，有極佳合掌村展望，謀殺底片及記憶體。小舖裡有賣各式紀念食物及飛驒高山紀念偶，很難不掏錢帶回紀念。和田家欣賞合掌造結構，也在明善寺對面買日本布丁大賞金獎綿密布丁。短遊3小時足夠，但最好住幸工門一晚，體驗愜意的村落人生。,Tripadvisor

"　２０数年ぶりに、白川郷を訪れました。当時は、飛騨高山から国道とは名ばかりの険しい道を通ってやってきましたが、現在は高速道路も完成して、白川郷ＩＣから合掌造り集落まではわずか３ｋｍでした。
　今回、集落をめぐっていて思ったことは、おみやげ屋さんや民宿、飲食店がとても増えたことです。そのおみやげ屋さんなどは合掌造りの建物を活用していました。もともとこの合掌造りに住み、この地で生活をしている人たちで維持してきた集落だったはずですが、この里を守り続けるためには観光用の産業として活用せざるを得ないのだと思いました。",Tripadvisor
"Sì, è davvero evocativo anche nel Terzo millennio. Noi siamo capitati sul finire del tramonto e i riflessi dei mille Torii di impronta shintoista sembravano quasi rosso vermigli

這個登錄為世界文化遺產的地方，早就看過照片，照的像一個日本的童話世界這麼美，我們來的時候他的特色小屋也就是好像雙手合掌的人字型屋頂，似乎沒有照片上那麼多，有不少建築已經改成現代式的建築，遊客很多，我們在這裡吃了飛䮝牛肉可樂餅、五平餅，後來也買了飛驒牛肉串，還看到一條小溪，幾個日本小孩在裡面玩，還抓到像手臂這麼長的魚，不過他們只是好玩，抓到以後又放回水裡。我們花200日圓搭車上到展望台，往下觀看，可以看到大部分的村落，然後再慢慢走下去。不過沒有待到晚上，所以沒有看到他們點上燈以後的美麗景色。,Tripadvisor
"Entrance is opposite the Fushimi Inari train station. You have to be reasonably fit to walk to the Inari shine at the top of the hill, the climb takes about 45 to 50 minutes, there are several rest stops and shops on the way up, beware though prices for drinks increase the higher you climb. There are plenty of shrines to view as well. The orange/red gates you walk through give you plenty of cover. Entrance to the site is free.",Tripadvisor

"雪の白川郷を見たくて2月の平日に行きました。バスを降りた途端帰ろうと思いました。アジア系の外国人で溢れかえりとんでも無い事になってました。裏道も人で溢れかえり、対岸に渡る橋も人が多く渡れませんでした。道は雪で凍り滑るのですが展望台ヘの道も人がいっぱい。人の頭越しに写真を撮る始末でした。次のバスまでの2時間が長かったです。日本人が行ってはいけない観光地NO1に推薦します。高山や高速道路からのアクセスがよすぎるためも原因かもしれません。
富山側の合掌集落は人も少なく良い雰囲気でした。",Tripadvisor
"C'est un incontournable de Kyoto, c'est certain. Mais peut être encore plus qu'ailleurs, il vous faudra composer avec la foule qui s'y presse. C'est sûrement mieux vers 7h/8h... mais le courage nous a manqué. La situation s'améliore plus on monte, mais sur la partie basse qui est la plus spectaculaire, faire des photos sans personne en arrière plan relève de la stratégie (attendre que le flux soit ""bloqué"" par un autre photographe, caché par une boucle...).",Tripadvisor
"Bellissimo santuario, prendetevi tutto il tempo necessario per visitarlo. Non é piccolo e il percorso dei Torii rossi é lungo. Personalmente direi almeno un paio d’orette buone…

"It was beautiful to walk through but it was a lot of walking! The first half is very crowded and many people are trying to take photos - many people we came across were trying to block people from continuing up the path to take photos without people in the picture. About halfway there was a small pit stop rest area that you can go in to sit if you order something. The menu was mainly a few drink options and sweet treats - perfect for the hot summer day!

Towards the beginning / entrance to the Shrine, where you can still see the train station in the distance, on the right-hand side, there is a stroller and bike parking lot where we left our stroller.",Tripadvisor

：商売繁昌・五穀豊穣の神様として名高い伏見稲荷大社は、全国に約3万社ある稲荷神社の総本宮。そのご利益や歴史的な価値もさることながら、京都観光の代名詞的な撮影スポットになっている朱塗りの鳥居がズラリと連なる「千本鳥居」が有名です。さらに伏見稲荷大社本殿の裏にある奥宮をはじめとする社・お塚・鳥居が建つ霊山「稲荷山」、祈願や願いの成就を占う「おもかる石」といった見どころやパワースポットが多いのも魅力です。伏見稲荷大社の御鎮座は和銅4年（711年）、1300年以上の歴史を持つ神社です。稲荷山の麓に本殿があり、稲荷山全体が神域とされています。農耕の神様として祀られ、その後、五穀豊穣だけでなく、「商売繁昌・家内安全の神様」として全国のあらゆる人に広く信仰されるようになりました。名前の由来は諸説ありますが五穀豊穣を意味する「稲が成る」から「イナリ」という名がついたといわれています。応仁元年（1467年）に起こった応仁の乱で多くの社殿が消失しましたが、明応8年（1499年）には本殿や社殿が再興されました。明治42年（1909年）には、本殿が国の重要文化財に指定されています。伏見稲荷大社の見どころといえば神秘的でフォトジェニックな絶景に出会える「千本鳥居」。本殿で参拝後、奥に進んで行くと、奥社奉拝所までの道に数え切れないほどの朱色の鳥居が並んでいます。鳥居は稲荷山全体で約1万基あり、そのうち二又に分かれたあたりが千本鳥居と呼ばれています。なぜこんなに鳥居が並んでいるのかというと、江戸時代以降、願い事が通る、通ったお礼の意味を込めた感謝の印として鳥居が奉納され、今日に広まったといわれています。参道を進み、鳥居をくぐり抜けると、鮮やかな朱色の「楼門」が姿を見せます。この楼門は、豊臣秀吉が母、大政所の病気平癒祈願成就に伴い、寄進されたもので、重要文化財にも指定されています。楼門の先にあるのが重要文化財に指定されている「外拝殿」、「本殿」、「内拝殿」です。「本殿」は神様がいらっしゃるとされる社殿、「拝殿」とは人々が参拝するための社殿です。伏見稲荷大社の拝殿は2つあり、内拝殿は本殿の前にあり、ここで参拝をします。外拝殿は楼門と本殿・内拝殿の間にあり、祭礼などの行事が行われます。稲荷大神のお使い（眷属）である「狐」。眷属も大神様同様に我々の目には見えません。境内にはその「眷属さん」がたくさんあります。「玉」や「鍵」、「巻物」や「稲穂」などを口にくわえ、多彩な表情をみせる様々な「眷属さん」がありますよ。千本鳥居を抜けると、「奥社奉拝所」が現れます。奥社奉拝所は稲荷山を遥拝するための場所です。ここで参拝し、帰る人もいますし、稲荷山三ケ峰をめぐる「お山めぐり」に向けたスタート地点でもあります。奥社奉拝所まで来たら、ぜひ試してみてほしいのが「おもかる石」です。石灯篭の前で願い事の成就を念じながら、石灯籠の上にのる宝珠石を持ち上げ、思っていたよりも軽ければ願い事は叶いやすく、重ければ叶うのは難しいという占いができる石とされています。奥社奉拝所や、そのさらに奥の三ツ辻辺りで折り返す方が多いのですが、実は境内はとても広く、稲荷大神が鎮座した稲荷山全体が信仰の対象となっています。標高約233メートルの稲荷山は一周約4キロ、2時間ほど。ご利益のあるお塚や見どころが随所にあり、この稲荷山をまわることを「お山めぐり」といいます。頂上にある「一ノ峰上社」は「末広大神」と称えられ、「末広がり」という意味を持つだけあって縁起が良いパワースポットです。また、お山めぐりの途中には、商売繁昌のご利益のあるお塚はもちろん、眼にまつわる神様「眼力社」や喉や咳にまつわる神様「おせき社」、無病息災のご利益があるとされる「薬力社」など、健康にちなんだお塚も多くあります。",Tripadvisor

"A place that looks straight out of a fairy tale. It’s simply stunning and breathtaking.　

The snow scene in winter (especially night view) is the most famous. Unfortunately, the snow was half gone when we visited. However, the scenery was still awesome.

It is highly recommended to walk up to the observation point on the hill. You can enjoy the beautiful panoramic view of Gassho Village along the way.

It is also great to pay to enter to visit the cottages to learn about its architecture and people's residences.",Tripadvisor
フランスからの友人との旅、稲が黄色くなりかけたタイミングでした。澄んだ水の流れる水路のニジマスが人気で、猛暑日でしたが世界中から多くの観光客が来ていて思い思いに楽しんでいました。,Tripadvisor
"I took the Nohi highway bus from Toyama (Bay #1 at Toyama Station South Exit). Tickets can be purchased online one month in advance. The fare is 2400 yen one way. There are no round trip tickets and must be purchased as two single trips. The confirmation email is the ticket. It's best to print it and show it to the driver. Seat numbers are assigned and set out in the email.

Shirakawa-Go is absolutely beautiful. It's true that there are lots of tourists but there's a reason. It is big enough that each person still gets a lot of personal space. There is an observation area which is some 10 to 15 mins walk uphill. It's an easy walk. If not, there's a shuttle but it's not frequent so might as well do the walk. After you reach the top, lots of tourists gather at one area to take the iconic shot. Keep going up couple more minutes and there is a rest area with restaurant and another area to take photos.

Down at the village, there are many places for take-out snacks and people who don't have much time ending up eating on the benches outside those take-out joints. There are some small restaurants. I noticed some people joining the queue, forgetting that at Japanese restaurants, one has to write their names and party size on a board at the restaurant entrance. Even if you line up, if you don't write your name, you won't be called.

There are some houses opened for visits for a small fee. I recommend visiting at least one.

I spent half a day there and really enjoyed my time there.",Tripadvisor
"A very interesting insight into feudal Japan and how most people lived. Fantastic to see authentic history preserved.

Although it is very much a tourist trap with the usual souvenirs and food shops it shows another side of Japan.",Tripadvisor
"As paisagens e a sensação de estar nesse lugar são incríveis. Chegamos de madrugada. Ficamos com medo já que tinha um aviso de possíveis ataques de javali, sobretudo enquanto estiver escuro. Porém uma pessoa que mora no local nos informou que não haveria qualquer problema. E a partir desse momento entramos .",Tripadvisor
"小学校の教科書で初めてみた合掌づくりの建物を間近で見られます。
この地区で生活してる方もおられる中で、せせらぎ公園駐車場からであい橋経由で観光客がたくさんやって来るという地域です。

景色は悪くないですし、雰囲気も良いです。

観光客は本当に多いです。

私もそうですが、高速道路が割と近くを走っていて便利だからなのでしょう。

そういう文化や建物を楽しむのが好きな方にはオススメスポットです",Tripadvisor
"Magical experience exploring traditional Japanese village.
Many little paths and buildings to explore.",Tripadvisor
"Definitely a place to visit. For a European, it looks like a SWiss or Austrian alpine village. Lots to see and do in and among the house. Toilets, cafe, small shops. Idyllic-looking place, but probably very harsh in the winter snows.",Tripadvisor
日本の原風景と言われる白川郷に8月の週末に行きました。午後に雲行きが怪しくなってきて、途中から降ったりやんだりの天気でした。見学時にはどうにかもってくれました。中には田んぼが綺麗に作られそれが良いアクセントになり白川郷の建物が良く映えていましたが、天気が伴わなかった所が残念でした。集落内に田んぼがある事から中に水路が通っていて綺麗な水が流れています。水路には鯉もですが、水が綺麗と言う事だと思いますが、鱒が泳いでいました。ここには普通に生活する方々が住んでいると言う事でやはり週末は家にいる方が多いのではないかと思います。そのためかそれぞれの家の敷地に車が止まっていました。写真撮影を楽しみたい方は週明けに来るのが良い様に思いました。また季節を変えて来たいところです。,Tripadvisor
第二次造訪比10年前商業化，多了很多手信店及食事處，遊人同市區差不多，不過景色同樣美麗，巴士車站亦比以前集中方便，都同樣值得去觀光,Tripadvisor
"Another one of those places on the tourist trek. You need to go and see it as it’s very impressive, but the place is heaving with tourists.
There are some fairly substantial walks if you want to get to the top, but it’s worth it for the view.",Tripadvisor
"Bestemt et besøg værd. Der var en del mennesker, men hvis man (som os) går hele vejen til toppen falder mange fra, og man får herved god mulighed for at opleve stemningen (et par steder) ved, at gå igennem portene selv.
Det er dog en lidt hård opstigning, men der er gode muligheder for at holde et hvil, og købe noget at drikke på vej op.",Tripadvisor

"Impossible à éviter dans un passage à Kyoto. Arrive à 8h. Du monde mais pas le pire arrive 2 heures après par vagues.
Cela reste tout de même un d’actuaire actif et ce tourisme de masse est… désorientant.

"A special experience walking through the dozens of red shrine gates, especially atmospheric in the evening. The site can be very busy, going very early or very late might be quieter.",Tripadvisor
We love hiking and Fushimi Inari was on the top of things to do in Kyoto when we planned this trip. We took the advise of many and woke up early in the morning to avoid the crowd as we had more than few things scheduled for rest of the day. We took a train from Kiyomizu Gojo and we were there by the entrance around 6 am. Only a handful of friendly travelers were present and made the hike go rather quickly. We hiked to the top and came back down in little over an hour. Walking through all the gates was beautiful and surreal. I'm glad that we were able to experience it.,Tripadvisor
거대한 도리이를 지나면 도요토미 히데요시가 세웠다고 전해지는 누각문이 나오고 본전으로 이어집니다. 본전 뒤편에서 진홍색 도리이가 빽빽하게 늘어선 길을 150m 정도 따라가면 작은 신사인 오쿠샤 배례소에 도달하게 됩니다. 또 도리이 길을 따라 걸어가면 연못을 만나게 됩니다. 이렇게 산 정상까지 약 2km가 도리이로 장식되어 있습니다. 본전에서 정상까지 왕복 약 2시간 코스이니 시간적인 여유가 있다면 도전해 보시기 바랍니다.,Tripadvisor
"　「日本の原風景」ともいえる白川郷の合掌造り集落。私たちは、白川郷の北の端に位置する萩町城跡展望台の駐車場に車を停めて、まず展望台からの眺めを楽しんだ後、坂道を下って集落へと向かいました。
　白川郷の合掌造り集落は、南北に１ｋｍあまり、東西は3～400ｍほどの広さです。集落内には観光客は車で入ることができませんが、歩いてみて回るにはちょうどよい広さなんです。中には、内部に入って見学できる合掌造りの建物も複数あるので、建物内を見学するのもおすすめですよ。",Tripadvisor
長年行ってみたいと思っていた白川郷についにいけました。どの角度からとっても絵になる日本の原風景です。屋根の葺き替え中の家屋もあり、保存には大変な努力がはらわれているのを感じました。畑や田に入らないように気を付けて撮影しましたが、これだけ数多くの合掌造りの集落は確かに素晴らしく見ごたえあります。,Tripadvisor

"Definitely one of the highlights of our entire Japan holiday!

It takes several hours and a LOT of steps to make it to the top, but the entire place is gorgeous so it's worth every step. Get there early, take your timr, and enjoy it!

Sad to see some of the torii gates falling into disrepair though. Come on Kyoto - spend some money on fixing this place!",Tripadvisor
コロナの影響で観光客が激減している中、一度は行ってみたいと思っていたこの場所に泊りではないですが訪れました。　連休中はそれなりだったようですが、その後ということもあって世界的な観光地ですが少し寂しい感じでした。 代わりにゆったり合掌造りの旧家を見学できました。Go Toキャンペーンのクーポン実施前ながら、こういう時期のためかキャッシュレスの大幅割引があちこちで行われていました。真冬の方がそれらしいのかもしれませんが、気候としては最高にマイルドで散策が快適でした,Tripadvisor
"集落全体が展示スペースのような雰囲気だと思っていたのですが、実際に訪れると人の暮らしが稲作を中心に営まれていて、実際に住んで集落を守りながら、観光と両立している様子が見れました。
冬は厳しい場所だと思うので、長い歴史の中でこの集落を守り続けてきた住民の方々を思うと、伝統とは？現代的な暮らしとの両立はどうしたらいいか？と、色々と考えさせられます。",Tripadvisor
"Luckily the place wasn't so crowded when I went there (ironically, thanks to COVID-19) but the weather was very unstable, thanks to an oncoming typhoon. The traditional thatched roof houses were quite a beauty to look at. Some are open to visitors but charge you a 300 yen admission. As you will be walking around a lot, it's best to visit during spring or fall when the weather is mild.

If it weren't for COVID_19, you should definitely book a round trip bus ticket in advance. I traveled from Kanazawa station, and purchased tickets at an information center nearby. There are also tickets to and from Takayama station.
Also, there are no trash cans, just like in most Japanese tourist spots. Bring plastic bags to put your trash in, so you can dispose of them when you get back to your hotel.",Tripadvisor
"川向こうの駐車場に止めて川を渡り合掌造り集落に入って行きました。

"Very special place, one of the highlights of my family's trip to Japan. Makes good pictures, too. There are a few options with regard of how much of the trail you are willing to cover. It's a longer way to the top of the mountain.",Tripadvisor
"A shrine with a ethereal feel, it is a privilege to be able to enter the place. It is well worth the hike to the top, as there are swarms of other tourists at the base which ruins the ambience, but these drop away fairly promptly once you start to climb. Lots of refreshment stops & nice views. There is some wildlife that can be spotted, but not approached. Budget 2 hours to the top and back.",Tripadvisor
"We visited twice during our trip to Kyoto. The first time we went in the evening. Lots of reviews talk about the magic of visiting at night, but honestly it’s underwhelming, you can’t appreciate the beautiful forest backdrop and the colour contrast between the orange and the green. The lighting is also minimal.

The second visit was early morning, I think around 5-5.30am. It was magical. Really a special experience. It was quiet and calm and you could appreciate the noises of the forest as well as the rising sun. It’s a longer walk than you think, but still very manageable.",Tripadvisor
Definitely worth going to this but be aware it's a long climb to the top and you will encounter many tourists. We went in early March and they were all out (of course we were one of them!). The climb and back via the thousand torii is very memorable although we were a bit surprised to see they were sponsored by business (although Coca Cola and McDonalds weren't represented). We went from Osaka via the Keihan Electric Railway to Inari station which is much cheaper than going on the Shinkansen and perfectly acceptable.,Tripadvisor
"Il villaggio montano, dichiarato patrimonio UNESCO, si trova a circa un'ora di distanza sia da Kanazawa che da Takayama ed é agevolmente raggiungibile con i mezzi pubblici... é composto da circa 200 tipiche costruzioni in stile giapponese, in minima parte abitate da autoctoni e per il resto adibite a museo/esposizione, negozi di souvenir, ristoranti ed altre attivitá commerciali... passaggiare nel villaggio é davvero suggestivo in quanto ci si cala completamente in un contesto davvero unico... anche visto dell'alto, il villaggio é spettacolare!",Tripadvisor
"Santuario iconico! I torii sono molto belli e passeggiarci sotto é un’esperienza bellissima.
Si possono vedere molti giapponesi che vanno a fare le offerte.",Tripadvisor
他の人のレビュー見て否定的なものもあり、あまり期待しないで行ったのですが、想像以上に良かったです。日光江戸村のように作られたものではなく、リアルにタイムスリップします。せせらぎ橋の村営駐車場に車を止めて、そこからせせらぎ橋を渡るとタイムスリップできます。駐車場場代が高いというコメントがありますが、そのくらいは村への収入として良いのではないかと。,Tripadvisor
"We reach early at around 8+am (from Takayama) and luckily us, the tour groups are not here yet so we have at least an hour of peaceful walk. Beautiful houses, which look like a praying hand. A must to go!

As it gets crowded, it is hard to take solo photos with the houses if you don't want others in your photo. My suggestion is to head to the open-air museum at the far side of the village if you have time as hardly anyone goes there.",Tripadvisor
"コロナ禍で外国人観光客の姿がほとんど見られなくなり、白川村など観光地にとっては大打撃で宿泊割引キャンペーンなどの努力を行っておられます。

"I knew while I was hiking it early in the morning (in comparison to when I went this summer @10AM) that this experience was one of the best I would ever have in my life. I truly felt that. I was completely stunned. It was just stupendous - every positive superlative. If you go in the morning.

I got there at 5:20AM. I only saw one other person until about 7:30. It felt like the entire place was mine. The hike was about 2.5-3 hours. However, it was so worth it. I remember enjoying the gates, really stopping and taking my time, almost in tears. It was that good. It felt I was in a Studio Ghibli Film. The actual gates themself are not that special. What makes the experience special is that it doesn't seem to end. One can keep walking up and up the mountain and the lightly dim orange and red gates will guard you from the rain. It was slightly raining when I went, and I really enjoyed the mist and fog; it added to the atmosphere.

I also saw many cats! They scared me at first because I thought they were other people. They were really cute. They were dimly lit around the shrines and the foliage (these massively tall, deeply verdant trees, with some autumn leaves) and it was just so special.

I cannot overstate how special this experience was for me. It was really a once-in-a-trillion experience. Please go when there is no one else!",Tripadvisor

It is possible to indulge in the 'zen'of Fushimi Inari-Taisha without a kazillion people around if you go early in the morning - 5.30am-7.30am. The lighting is fantastic for photo's and it does allow for some tranquil peace time before the hoards arrive. What a sacred place - it really is stunning. We also enjoyed the street food on the way out of the temple to the left - it was a nice treat after a busy but soulful hike. Arigato gozaimusu from New Zealand..,Tripadvisor
"Wir waren mitten am Tag in Dezember da, an einem Schönwettertag. Ja, es gab viele Touristen und Gruppen, aber vermutlich massiv weniger als im April/ Mai oder September.
Meine Empfehlungen: Keinen Kimono mieten (weil nicht gerade Wanderkleidung...) und dafür genug Zeit einplanen, so dass man bis auf den Gipfel laufen kann. Bis oben ist es ein befestigter Weg mit vielen Stufen, aber extrem anstrengend ist es wirklich nicht. Vorteil: Den oberen Teil des Weges machen nur die wenigsten Touristen, Gruppen haben dafür bspw. gar keine Zeit. Daher also peeerfekt um Fotos zu machen, von den Aussichtspunkten einen tollen Blick auf Kyoto zu geniessen und einfach eine gute Zeit zu haben, da der Weg wirklich mitten durch den Wald geht.

Zeitlich ca. 2-3 Stunden für die gesamte Besichtigung einplanen, dann ist es entspannt.",Tripadvisor
"Incontrounale à Kyoto, l'endroit est super beau et mystique. Ambiance très spitituelle et calme. Par contre il faut y aller très tôt le matin. On y est allé vers 7h, et quand on est redescendu vers 8h30 il y avait déjà énormément de monde et de perches à selfies.",Tripadvisor

"It took us a slow 2-2.5 hrs to complete the entire loop. As everyone has mentioned it’s very crowded at the beginning of the route but the crowd lessens and you will get nice pictures of the Tori gates without other people around if you hang in there. There are steps to climb and at the 3/4 mark you get very nice views of Kyoto. There isn’t a view at the top, it’s another shrine so it might feel underwhelming to some. I personally felt a sense of achievement to have made it to the top. Not for the unfit or if you have walking issues. Wear comfortable shoes. At every station there are resting points. There are shrine cats!!! When you walk down. Personally they were the highlight. Who doesn’t love cats!",Tripadvisor
"行く前は、鳥居がいっぱいある神社のイメージでしたが、実際行ってみると、そのスケール感、荘厳さ、美しさ、とにかく素晴らしいの一言でした。
現在は参拝の方が非常に多いのですが、割と空いた夜は、その素晴らしさを更に引き立ててくれると思います。",Tripadvisor
"Being on a tight schedule, we didn't have time to walk the whole 4km (10,000 torii gates) path but we were still able to walk through parts of it which was packed with crowds of people. The gates are sponsored by businesses and corporations. Fushimi apparently means hidden or underground water. There were excellent food stalls lining the path out of the shrine.",Tripadvisor
I made two trips on the same day. First thing in the morning before dawn and just before dusk. The dawn visit was very idyllic. Not many fellow tourists and a lot of cats. I only went half way up to the pond but this was still an amazing experience. The afternoon visit was very different. Still some cats but so many tourists especially in the lower Torii which thinned out the higher we went. Still only went up the pond.,Tripadvisor
Nice hike up the hill to get to this monument. Beautiful. Very crowded so be careful but lots of chances to take photos. Enjoyed.,Tripadvisor

1月9日に訪問しました。当初は金沢駅発着の、五箇山と白川郷の両方を巡るツアーに参加する予定でしたが、大雪の影響により中止。仕方なく、五箇山は断念し、定期バスで金沢駅から白川郷まで行きました。高速はかなりゆっくりの走行で、30分程度の遅延で白川郷に到着。定期バスは車内にトイレが無いので、高山まで行く人も必ず白川郷でトイレを済ませた方が良いです。特に私が訪問した日は大雪でしたので、高山の到着時間がかなり遅れる可能性が高いため、高山まで行く人も必ず白川郷でトイレを済ませるようにアナウンスもありました。白川郷は雪で一面は真っ白。お店もかなり休業中でした。バスターミナルの方曰わく、五六豪雪並みの大雪とのことです。展望台は閉鎖されており行けませんでしたが、その分、貴重な大雪の白川郷を堪能できました。予備知識がまったく無い状態で白川郷に着いても大丈夫です。バスターミナルの方が親切にアドバイスして下さいます。星1つ減らした理由は大雪の影響で村内の観光が殆ど出来なかったためです。一面が真っ白で道が分からなくなった際も、住民の方が親切に教えてくれました。白川郷はアミューズメントパークではありません。実際に住まれて生活している方が多くいらっしゃるため「お邪魔させて頂いている」という謙虚な気持ちは大切です。,Tripadvisor
We arrived around 8am and it wasn't too crowded. It was a pleasant walk up to the shrine and the views are amazing. There are rest stops along the way if you need to take a break. Worth a visit!,Tripadvisor
It’s hauntingly beautiful and like nothing else I’ve ever seen. The gates never stop until you reach the actual Inari shrine at the top of the mountain. The hike is worth every step of your willing.,Tripadvisor

"We went here late at night, which was cool to see it all lit up, but keep in mind all the lights basically turn off at 10pm and then it’s pretty creepy on the woods. I’d recommend going at sunset and stay a bit to see the light after that. A must see, for sure, though.",Tripadvisor
"梅雨前に立ち寄りました。
　気温が既に28度と陽射しは強く、高山的な涼しさはありませんでした。
　帽子は必須だなと思いました。

　平日のせいか、7割が外人だったようです。
　食事をしようと思った場合は、混んでいるのではやめはやめの行動がいいと思いますが、軽食やスナックで良ければ、メインの混んだところを外すと、意外に食べるところはありました。

　次は、雪の頃にお泊まりでのんびりと来たいと思いました。",Tripadvisor

いつもテレビや雑誌で見て一度は行ってみたかった場所でした。思ったより感動は少なかったのですが、多分全て回ることが出来なかったからだと思います。行った日はとても気温が高くてバテバテでした。行くのなら秋が良かったのかも知れません。場所自体はJR京都駅から伏見稲荷駅で下車して目の前でした。,Tripadvisor

10月中旬に参りました。外国人の中にはマスクをしていない方も多いのですが、まだマスクは必要と記されていました。参道の真ん中は神様が歩くので、端を歩くべしと、自覚的に端を歩いている方がいらっしゃいました。私も倣いました。今度は、山の頂上まで行ってみます。,Tripadvisor
"Fushimi Inari är en otroligt vacker och stämningsfull helgedom! Det tycker alla andra också, så var beredd på att trängas! Vi var här vid niotiden på morgonen men det var alldeles för sent för att slippa de stora besöksmassorna, så jag rekommenderar ett besök betydligt tidigare. Var beredd på att få träningsvärk efter besöket.",Tripadvisor

"Lors de ma deuxième visite à Fushimi Inari, j'ai été frappé par l'abondance de visiteurs dès l'entrée du temple. Les sentiers étaient animés, et il y avait une atmosphère d'excitation et de curiosité. Cependant, en continuant ma marche vers le sommet de la colline, j'ai remarqué que le nombre de personnes diminuait progressivement.

L'ascension des innombrables torii rouges était non seulement un exercice physique, mais aussi un voyage intérieur. Les allées bordées de torii créaient une ambiance mystique,

En atteignant le sommet de la colline, j'ai été récompensé par une vue magnifique sur la ville de Kyoto et ses environs. C'était un moment de tranquillité et de contemplation, loin de l'agitation des foules en bas.",Tripadvisor

Nous sommes montés en haut du sommet Inari à 17h. Arrivée vers 18h. Il y a des distributeurs de boissons tout le long de la montée. L’horaire est idéal car il fait moins chaud qu’en journée (36 degrés ce jour là) et on profite du coucher du soleil sur la ville à la descente.,Tripadvisor

伏見稲荷大社の境内も、午前中だったせいか？観光客は少なめで、ノンビリゆっくり散策＆拝観が出来て良かったです。

やはり圧巻だったのは「千本鳥居」ではないでしょうか、あまり興味がない人でも凄いと思う「伏見稲荷大社」でした。",Tripadvisor

"Very interesting place, and great atmosphere.

BUT... this is a place of worship, so don't act like so many jerk tourists!
I saw Russian eating sandwiches in front of the ""no food allowed"" sign, Chinese tourists burping and yelling like no one else is here, and all kind of instagram fashionista blocking the tori gates tunnel so they could get that special instagram picture...

Show some respect to the place and to other visitors please. This shrine is not an amusement park!!

I'm so glad I got to visit a few years ago too, before the tourist rush!",Tripadvisor
"鳥居が圧巻。噂では１門２０万から１６０万円。場所によって金額が違うそうで、大人気で申し込んでも中々設置してもらえないとも。

登っている時は朱塗りの鳥居ですが振り返ってみてくださいそうしますと寄進をされた方の名前が出てきます（写真撮ってきましたので見てみてください）正面と振り返りの見た目が違います。

神様がいるのは間違いないと思います。鳥居も変な場所にピントを合わせると空間が歪んでいて合わないです。結構ありました　本来であればそういう神域は撮影しては無礼に当たるのですが、あまり気にせず撮ってきてしまいました……。

とはいえ霊能者の方によると本尊は一番上の本社にいるそうです。わたしは疲れ果てて途中でＵターンしてしまいました",Tripadvisor

名物の千本鳥居まではそんなに遠くないです。私は時間があったので山頂まで挑戦しましたが、とても良かったです。山頂はひらけてないので登山的な感じとは違うかもですが、達成感があります。私は健康ではありますが、普段スポーツとかしてないのに、伏見稲荷パワー？なのかどんどんガンガン登っていけました。そしてそんな疲れませんでしたし翌日の筋肉痛もありませんでした。伏見稲荷パワーすごい！！,Tripadvisor

"この「伏見稲荷大社」を訪れるのは２回目です。
まだ、コロナ騒ぎの「コ」の字もない３年前の１１月が最初の訪問でした。
丁度、大学の同寮会が京都の宇治で開催され出席するために、１人でJR奈良線を途中下車して初めて「伏見稲荷大社」を訪れました。
その時は、駅のホームから改札口、道路、境内のありとあらゆるところに、観光客がひしめき合っており、特に海外の観光客が８～９割と多いように感じました。また、若い男女の着物姿の外国人や日本人が、そこここと写真を取り合っており、特に千本鳥居は渋滞が激しく、途中で引き返す状況でした。
　今回（2020.11.08.）家内と２人で、２泊３日の「錦秋の京都観光」にGo-Toトラベルを利用して訪問した初日の「東福寺」の次に「伏見稲荷大社」を訪れました。ところが、３年前とは打って変って、駅のホームも改札口も券売機も道路も境内も観光客が少なく、外国の観光客は殆ど見当たらない状況でした。
ゆっくりと境内を観光し写真も沢山撮れました。千本鳥居でも途中途中で家内とお互い写真を撮り合うことが出来ました。今度は、老体に鞭打って「御劔社」まで登って、お参りした後、折り返して戻ってきました。
休憩所「啼鳥菴（ていちょうあん）」にある「稲荷茶寮」のお茶屋さんに腰掛け、お庭を愛でながら頂いた暖かいコーヒーが、心地よく疲れた体を癒してくれました。夕方の神社の冷気が、清々しく感じた「伏見稲荷大社」でした。",Tripadvisor
1月5日訪問すると　境内で《志るしの杉　添付　写真参照》の文字が見えたので　境内で聞くと　《初午の日（2021年2月3日）》に参拝すると　《志るしの杉》なるものが　授与されることを知りました。又　[外拝殿]の周囲に12個の吊り燈籠があり　ﾃﾞｻﾞｲﾝが夫々異なりますが　説明文（添付　写真参照）を読むと　《黄道12宮》を示していることも　こちらには　何度も参拝していますが　初めて知りました。こちらを訪問する機会あれば　自分の星を示す吊り燈籠を探しては如何でしょうか。,Tripadvisor
"２月５日に参拝

一時は狂ったようにインバウンドが押し寄て、神域ではなく観光地になっていたけど、神様のご意思が働いたのか、コロナで消え去りました。

JRでも京阪でもアクセスは便利です。稲荷神社の総本宮で、参道の数多くの朱塗りの鳥居はあまりにも有名です。全国有数の観光スポットだとは思いますが、コロナも影響もあってかそれほど混んでなくて快適に見れました。稲荷山へのハイクは結構距離あるので体力に応じて無理しない方がいいです。,Tripadvisor
Tempat yang cukup baik untuk berfoto. Sangat populer di kalangan turis lokal maupun internasional. Jangan takut lelah untuk naik tangga disini karena tangga yang tinggi hanya yang di dekat gerbang. jangan lupa foto di bambu bambu warna orennya,Tripadvisor
ひさびさの出張で参拝いたしました。コロナ禍により参拝者はまばらです。自分の好きなところで写真撮影出来ました。残念なところは数年前の混雑を受けて、おもかる石までの鳥居が一方通行になってしまったところです。此処は二股の所でどちらに行こうか迷うところが良いのです。,Tripadvisor
"コロナの中、久しぶりに参拝しました。
人の少ない伏見稲荷は最高です。そもそも神聖な神社が観光地になるのは少し問題なのかもしれません。人は穢れているからこそ、神社に詣でます。より本来の聖域に近く、十分満足できるものでした。",Tripadvisor
"駅から歩いていきました。電車のアクセス便利です。千本鳥居までなら、それほど歩きにくくもなくて、着物でいきましたが、かなりすいていて、写真がごれました。
朱塗りがとてもきれいです。写真スポット、着物きていくと映えておすすめ",Tripadvisor

今回は絶対行こうと思ってました。JR京都駅から稲荷駅まで2駅¥150と近く駅降りてすぐの場所にあります。朝9時くらいに到着しましたが観光客は多くてびっくりしました。
有名は千本鳥居に感動。すべてを歩ききらずに帰ってきました。次回歩ききりたいと思います。",Tripadvisor
"ぐるっと1周するなら軽い山登りをする気持ちで挑んだ方が吉。
赤井鳥居がずらりと並ぶ様は圧巻だが行く時間や天気にもよる。
写真を見て綺麗だから同じ写真を撮りたいと思ってもまず無理。人が多いし奥に進めば進むほど草木は覆い茂り大変。
時間も結構使うので、思い出だけを作るなら四つ辻くらいまで登って後はUターンで良いと思います。
あちらこちらにある狛犬ならぬ狛狐はすべてデザインが違います。一つ一つ違いを探すのも面白いです。
パワースポット的な場所としては最高の部類。強い願掛けをするならおすすめの場所でした。",Tripadvisor

映えスポットということでたくさんの若い人が来てにぎわっていました。予備知識なしで行ってしまったもので、山頂まで１時間、往復２時間かかると周りにいた修学旅行の先生が説明されているのを聞き、途中で戻ってきました。上のほうはまた風景も美しいようなので、時間がたっぷりある場合はぜひ試してみるとよさそうです。登山の途中にカフェなどない（あっても休み？）のが玉に瑕というところでしょうか。,Tripadvisor
"朝7時ころ到着し、ゆっくりと境内を回り始めました。関係者の方々が箒で掃除されていました。あとから思うとそこは祈祷所なんだと思いますが、私たちはお参りできる場所だと勘違いしてしまい中に入ってしまいました。そこに神主さんらしき方が中におられて「あ、ここはまだ準備中なんですよ」というような内容のことを言われたので、私たちは「すみません」と言って慌てて退出しました。すると、近くで箒を掃いていたおじさんが、出てきた私たちに向かい「だめだ、そこ入っちゃ！」と大きな声で怒鳴ったんです。神主さんと私たちのやり取りを当然聞いていた距離で、謝っていたのは聞いている筈だし、私たちはあっけにとられて言葉も出なかったんです。すると更に「なんだその目つきは！」と今度は顔を近づけてきて威嚇する態度。私たちの目つきが悪いって怒り始めたんです。ここは神社でしょ。こんなことされるとは思わなかった。そこへ神主さんがやってきて「○○さん、もうやめてくださいよ」と間に入り、私たちにお辞儀をしました。おじさんはこちらを睨み、不満そうに別の場所の掃除へ行かされました。神主さんの様子からすると、そのおじさんはこうしたトラブルを起こすのは初めてではないといった感じでした。せっかく関東から参拝に来たんですが、そのおじさんにまた会ったら今度は何をされるんだろうと思うと、私も夫も怖くなり、参拝は諦めて、そのまま駅へ引き返しました。神職に就く方がそんなに怒りに満ちているなんて、悲しくなりました。
各地の伏見稲荷神社をたくさん参拝して、いつか伏見稲荷大社をお参りしようね、とふたりで楽しみにしていてやっと京都まで行けたのに。
皆さんにはこんなことがありませんように。",Tripadvisor
You need a certain level of fitness and tolerance for crowds. As you go higher in the hike the crowd thins out but it’s still busy but I must admit it’s golden week now so go early.,Tripadvisor
This is a lovely shrine to visit with lots of buildings around the main shrine. Walking through the thousands of torii gates is amazing and it gets quieter the higher up you go. We went on a weekday so it wasn't too busy but there are lots of people taking photos/selfies walking through so be patient.,Tripadvisor

"Es un lugar muy especial, lo que ocurre es que hay tanta gente que se rompe la magia.
En la parte inferior vas caminando en fila india, sin espacio ni para ver ni para disfrutar, al ritmo que te marcan.
A medida que vas subiendo el paseo va siendo más agradable. Recomiendo por tanto subir hasta arriba, no tano porque haya nada especial si no porque hay menos gente, los toris se van viendo más integrados en la naturaleza, con cementerios muy llamativos.
Merece la pena el esfuerzo.",Tripadvisor
"We first visited around 9am in the morning when there were lots of people coming in and it was too busy for us. We visited for the second time early one morning around 6am and it was much more peaceful and we enjoyed the walk up through the gates more without having to stop and start with everyone taking selfies and not considering others. An interesting place to visit if you get off the beaten track of the gates as there are many places to visit within the complex itself. Allow a good couple of hours if you want to walk up to the top, though we didn't go all the way up.",Tripadvisor

"This Shinto shrine is dominated by the 10k red Torii gates. These apparently lead up to the top of the mountain, so I only went along those near the shrine, which is what most people were doing. Otherwise it's a nicely presented red shrine and gates.",Tripadvisor
"Making the journey to the top is really rewarding as a personal achievement and for memories, although the top really doesn't have anything special, nor does it offer a landscape, the whole journey there I think is the reward, always with new things and new angles to observe both the nature that surrounds the place and the toriis, I highly recommend it to anyone who manages to make the entire journey.",Tripadvisor
Great experience seeing all the Torii but it was super busy at 3:45 and you may have to stop and go often to let people take pictures going through them. Lots of Japanese souvenirs and many vending machines. I suggest you go either really earlier or really late since it’s open 24/7,Tripadvisor

"Took a bus tour from Kanazawa. The tour included traditional lunch and then we explored on our own. We went to the observation deck first, you can either walk up the hill or take a shuttle. It is an easy walk for most people. Nice view, but quite a few people.

We also visited Nagase house, paid a small fee to enter. It is one of the less busy houses and had lots of artifacts inside.

We got a few snacks and browsed some shops on our walk. We tried grilled beef skewers and pork tongue, local milk, and milk ice cream. Many shops sold similar things.

We also went to the famous photo site of the three houses, all the way at the end of the village, which was quiet. We occasionally saw fish swimming in the drains.

There is plenty to see here for a day trip - we didn't cross the bridge to see the outdoor museum area, it did look quite busy and we were running out of time.",Tripadvisor
"This shrine is easily accessed from Inari station which is two stops from the main Kyoto train station on the Nara Line. The temple complex and the walk through the Torii gates is incredibly busy no matter what time of day you were there. The shrine feels a bit like a tourist trap with lots of shops selling over priced goods and wishes at 1,000 yen each. The walk up through the gates is a steady incline but not too demanding and it takes about 45 minutes to get to some nice viewpoints over Kyoto and away from some of the crowds. The return walk can be done as a circuitous route and this was back is much quieter which allows you to enjoy the ambience.",Tripadvisor
"Anda harus mempunyai stamina yang prima untuk sampai atas, ada 14 pos, dan naik turun bisa mencapai 2 jam jika anda tidak mempunyai stamina pos 4/5 disarankan",Tripadvisor
"Fushimi Inari Shrine is perhaps the most recognized icon of Kyoto. It is said that Irogu no Hatanokimi shot a rice cake, which turned into a swan and flew away. Eventually the swan landed on a peak of a mountain, where an auspicious omen occurred and rice grew. Inari is the Japanese word for rice. There are more than 10,000 closely-spaced vermilion torii gates that wind over the hills of Mount Inari beyond the entrance to the shrine. To hike through all the gates up the mountain would take 2-3 hours. Each of the famous torii shrine gates has been donated by an individual or a Japanese business in the hope of receiving good luck and fortune. Even our early February visit, there were thousands of tourists taking selfies.",Tripadvisor
"Fushimi Inari-taisha non è solo un santuario a Kyoto, Giappone, ma un vero e proprio punto di riferimento iconico e un'esperienza affascinante. Ecco la mia recensione, considerando diversi aspetti:

Fascino visivo:

Migliaia di torii arancioni: Le migliaia di torii vermigli che si snodano su per la montagna sono la vera star dello spettacolo. Passeggiarci sotto crea un tunnel suggestivo, perfetto per scatti fotografici mozzafiato.
Santuario sereno e statue di volpi: Lungo il percorso si trovano santuari decorati con cura e statue di volpi affascinanti, che aggiungono all'importanza spirituale e culturale del luogo.
Abbraccio della natura: La vegetazione lussureggiante e l'atmosfera serena offrono una piacevole fuga dal caos della città.
Esperienze:

Viaggio spirituale: La salita offre un'opportunità per la riflessione e la connessione spirituale, soprattutto per chi è interessato alle credenze shintoiste.
Sfida moderata: La salita non è eccessivamente faticosa, ma presenta scalini, quindi considera il tuo livello di forma fisica.
Immersione culturale: Immergiti nella cultura giapponese osservando le pratiche tradizionali e interagendo con la gente del posto.
Da tenere presente:

Affollamento: Preparati alla folla, soprattutto in alta stagione. Valuta le prime ore del mattino o i giorni feriali per un'esperienza più tranquilla.
Accessibilità: La salita prevede scalini e superfici irregolari, che potrebbero non essere adatte a tutti.
Comportamento rispettoso: Ricorda che si tratta di un luogo sacro, quindi vestiti in modo sobrio e sii attento a rumore e comportamento.
Impressioni generali:

Fushimi Inari-taisha è un'esperienza unica e indimenticabile. Che tu sia alla ricerca di connessione spirituale, immersione culturale o semplicemente immagini mozzafiato, è una tappa obbligata per qualsiasi viaggiatore a Kyoto. Preparati però alla folla e pianifica la tua visita di conseguenza.",Tripadvisor
"It wasn’t my favorite temple in Kyoto but it’s pretty impressive. It covers a very large area and the grounds are very nice. There are thousands of the orange arches. They really catch your eye initially but the novelty eventually wears off.

A beautiful trail through the Fushimi Inari-taisha Shrine all the way through to the mountain top. It was a long and exhausting walk however.,Tripadvisor
"This picturesque Shinto shrine of the gods of rice, called Fushimi Inari Shrine 伏見稲荷大社, is one of the must see in Kyoto, . It has thousands of red torii gates lining up the trails behind the main shrine. The trails will take people into the forest in the Inari mountain. The torii gates are known as Senbon Torii (""thousands of torii gates"". The hike to the top of the mountain can bev2-3 hour and we took about 45 min to the half way point when we turned back down. There were several pit stop points selling souvenirs & drinks.",Tripadvisor

"I would love to give this a five star review as it's really spectacular with all the tori gates, but it was so overcrowded that it was really difficult to enjoy most of the visit. I think it's worth getting here early - we arrived late afternoon so we probably timed it completely wrong. It's open 24 hours so we should have gone early morning really.

The temple itself is very nice and the walk through the tori gates is spectacular, but the first part of the walk is so crowded with people, it was impossible to move at a regular pace, you have to plod along with the sardine tin. I would recommend going up to the upper parts of the walk as the crowds petered out significantly the further up we went, and you can really appreciate your surroundings.

The walk back down through multiple small shrines is also really interesting.",Tripadvisor

"I hiked to the top of the mountain for the early morning views. Despite the hundreds of tourists at the bottom, it’s definitely worth the climb as they continue to thin as you go up. The history was interesting to learn about so be sure to read up before you go as it makes the journey more meaningful. The people do thin out the farther up you go, and there are very few people that actually journey to the top or did when I was there. By the time I came down the number of people at the bottom had at least doubled by noon.

The view of the city from the top is worth the climb if not interested in the spiritual path.",Tripadvisor
我们去的时候下着毛毛细雨，屋顶上没有一点雪，好可惜，人很多，去的时候坐的浓飞巴士，最好提前预定指定席。村子里吃的也不少，口味不错，不因为景点就特别贵,Tripadvisor

鼎鼎大名的白川鄉合掌村風景優美，遊人可以行上山上從高觀賞。自駕遊的人要經過一條11公里的山中隧道，絕對是難得的經歷。,Tripadvisor
"Despite the crowd, this place is amazing to visit. The hike to the top is well worth the effort as you can see big part of Kyoto from above, and go through the thousands of torii gates on your way. It's moderate difficulty and you're going through a paved path all the way up. Most of it is in shade too so even in summer it was ok.",Tripadvisor
"世界遺産の白川郷に一度は行ってみたいと訪れました。
先に、五箇山の菅沼集落を見てから行きました。
駐車場に停めて、吊り橋を渡り集落へ。
外国人をはじめ、観光客がとても多いです。さすがです。写真などで見たことのある風景が広がっていますが、思ったより、合掌造りでない家が多いと感じました。
観光用のおみやげ屋なども多くありました。展望台から見た景色も、思ったより合掌造りの家が少なく感じました。
人の生活している集落なので、生活感があることは良いのですが、お盆のせいか集落内に自動車が多く、写真の邪魔と感じてしまいました。でも、これは、仕方のないことですね。
貴重の集落をこれからもきちんと残していきたいものと感じました。",Tripadvisor
We came in the afternoon and unfortunately it rained as soon as we reached the shrine. We waited 40 minutes and luckily before it got dark we managed to explore the area. I’ve seen a lot of posts and nice pictures before deciding to come and visit the temple and I’m glad I did come. I think I had about 10k steps all together to explore the area coming from the train station. So better were comfortable clothes and shoes!,Tripadvisor
"This is a must-visit in Kyoto! The place resonates with energy and the prayers are also very calming and beautiful
For those who cannot walk the entire path can also opt for a short cut.
We did the entire stretch of the gates and it was a good trek. Please wear good shoes. There are small shrines along the way and there are intricate wooden statues that reflect Japanese culture. The entire experience is mesmerizing.
The view on the top is just amazing and you can see the whole city.",Tripadvisor

La montée continue sur 25 minutes pour atteindre le sommet.

"Arriving at Kanazawa Port on our 14 day Maasdam voyage encircling Japan, we took the Shore Excursion ""Shirakawago On Your Own""($100 each) for the 55 mile drive southeast. Nearly 10 tunnels(one 9 km long) climbed through lush green mountains exposing valleys of rice fields until arriving at this village of 450 buildings.
We followed the tourists walking the cement suspension bridge over the Shokawa River to walk 3 km through this preserved 15th C village(Ogimachi) focusing on the perfect photo of the gassho-type(praying hand A-frame) thatched roof structures framed within the small rice fields and rushing water channels. We had plenty of time to stop at one of the 3 open homes($3 each) to inspect the black interior construction and layout.
Its many restaurants, souvenir shops and few inns support the maintenance of this UNESCO site that some may find overcrowded and touristy. Our 3 hour tour was well worth our visit.",Tripadvisor

This is characterized by a steep slanting thatched roof. Design is exceptionally strong and can withstand the heavy snowfall in the area. The village can be reach from the big parking area from a bridge. The village is mostly shop and restaurants. It has three houses that you can visit at a small entrance free. This is far and must visit. Suggest you join a tour group. It took us three hours to and from Nagoya. It is worth noting tha on the way back, we pass through 55 tunnels through mountains.",Tripadvisor
合掌造りの建物は素晴らしく、見事に保存されていますが、観光客が多すぎて、完全に観光地化しており、日本的な山間の農村の雰囲気を求めて行くとがっかりします。特に外国人観光客の割合が多く、時間帯によっては外国語しか聞こえませんでした。そうした話が通じない観光客相手に慣れてしまっているせいか、現地の方々の対応も不愛想な印象で残念でした。ある合掌造りの建物では、外見を撮影していたら、「うちは撮影お断りです！」と怒鳴られました。一般の民家ではなく食堂で、敷地内に入ったわけでもなく、公道から撮影していたにもかかわらずです。観光客が増えることで、村がうるおい、地域の伝統や独自性が保存されるのは良いことですが、白川郷の観光価値を守るためには、入村制限なども考える時期なのではないでしょうか。,Tripadvisor

A quick taxi ride from Kyoto station took us to the famous Fushimi Inari Shrine and Tori gates. The shrine at the entry and the up hill climb was awesome. Never ending Tori gates with great picture ops. We didn't climb to the very top, turned back after 45 minutes climb.

Next to the shrine entrance there are a bunch of street food vendors serving amazing noodles, kobe stake etc along other things. Overall we spent close to 6 hours at the shrine. Went back the same day to Tokyo and reached around 10pm.

It's worth going to the top even with misty rain. The clouds coming off the mountain are magical. The accessible path was closed when we arrived, unsure how far it goes up. The steps can be slippery when wet wear good shoes. Went with my elementary aged children, spouse, and 66 yr old mother.
By 9-9:30, the bottom of the shrine was flooded with people.",Tripadvisor
"Shirakawa-go suffers from it's success. Daily, herds of buses discharge hordes of tourist who swarm the town. Noisy, chaotic and although few are significant - rude people. In a culture that values quiet, order and manners. It is a gong show at the zoo and you are in the cage with the monkeys. BUT when the tourist buses leave the village transforms into itself into a magical mystical place. One star during the day, 5 stars during the late evening or early morning. If you go stay overnight at one of the gassho style accommodations",Tripadvisor
世界遺産の白川郷に行ってきました。何と言っても世界遺産の場所なのに、合掌造りの建物の庭に洗濯物が干してあったのがとっても印象的でした。夏なので、とってものどかな風景に心癒されますが、冬だととっても大変な場所ではないかなと思いました。とても暑い日だったのですが、見学できる合唱造りの家にお邪魔して見学してみると最上階の部屋は風が入りこんでとても気持ちよく涼しかったです。これが合掌造りの効果なのですかね。また1階には囲炉裏がありまして、とても雰囲気がよく、ここで食事ができたらなあとできないのがとても残念に思いました。本当に合掌造りを考えた日本人の知恵には感心いたします。またここはどぶろくが有名なのですかね。店を覗くと、アルコールをとばしたどぶろくの飲み物とかお菓子が多くありました。どぶろくのソフトクリームは自分が探した限りでは写真の1件だけでしたので、ここで買ってみました。おいしいけど、普通のソフトクリームとあまり変わらないかなという感想です。とてものどかで癒される風景に一度は訪れても損はしないところです。,Tripadvisor

また、村内は火気厳禁なのに歩きタバコしてる日本人観光客がいたり、痰を吐く中国人観光客を見たり、あれだけ人が来れば景色は素晴らしいけど人のせいで嫌な思いをすることはあるだろうなと思います。

"Vale il viaggio passeggiare per questo paesino pieno di riso. Alcune case sono visitabili come la Wada e la Nagase. Prenotare per tempo i bus per l'andata e il ritorno. Non è molto grande ed è pieno di canalette dove scorre l'acqua che bagna le risaie tra le case. Nota negativa abbiamo incontrato un autista del bus per l'osservatorio che, probabilmente, odiava gli italiani. Dopo aver pagato i 200 yen a testa, ci ha richiamato dal finestrino e ha preteso il pagamento del ritorno che avremmo potuto fare a piedi o con altro autista, senza rilasciare nessuna ricevuta.
Quando siamo saliti con gli altri passeggeri sul pulmino del ritorno ha fatto partire sul suo cellulare un cartone animato giapponese in italiano che diceva parolacce, tipo ""carogne andatevene"". All'uscita ci ha detto di pagare di nuovo e abbiamo detto di aver già pagato e ha alzato la voce. A quel punto, dato che non valeva la pena per 400 yen avere a che fare con un gran maleducato e ladro, glieli abbiamo regalati e siamo andati via.",Tripadvisor

まず行く季節、ですが夏もいいと思うのですが個人的にはやはり冬ですね。他の方も写真あげられているのでそこを見てどちらの時期に行くのがいいか判断してください。圧巻ですよ。服装は重装備、特に靴は普段履いている靴でもみんなが歩いている轍を通ればいいのですが、でも防水性のある靴が絶対いいと思います。
あと白川郷を一望できる高台があるのでそこからの写真を収めれば、もう上出来ではないでしょうか。
あとタイミングにも寄りますが外国人のツアー客が多いのがちょっと風情を無くしている気がします。
もっと一日にこれる数を絞るとかした方がいいと思いますけどね。
大人しくそこにあるものをありがたく享受する姿勢がある観光客ならいいですけど、まるでどこかのテーマパークに来たみたいな人もいますから。

"Shirakawa is a village located in Ōno District, Gifu Prefecture and it is World Heritage site, We visited as part of the itinerary of our Titan Essence of Japan tour, and it was well worth a visit. It is geographically remote from other habitation but is in an absolutely stunning valley setting. We stopped first at the Observatory above the village to get a comprehensive view from above, and it was also really interesting to see rice field being planted both by hand and by machine.
We then drove down into the village which is obviously a great tourist attraction as it had a massive coach park by the side of the river. Most of the village is across the river and there is a very safe concrete suspension bridge which enables you to walk across.Like most places that we visited in Japan the village was exceptionally clean and well maintained despite the heavy tourist footfall.
The village is exceptionally pretty as most of the houses are built in traditionally wooden style buildings with steep thatched roofs. many of the properties are still in use as family homes and therefore visitors need to respect privacy-would we like someone wandering into our garden or opening our doors?!!
The village is very easy to walk around as land is flat and paths are well established. You can purchase souvenirs and snacks there as there are a number of shops.
One of the properties worth visiting is the 3 storey Wada House which was constructed in about 1800. This was the home of the Wada family who were prominent in the village, and this is reflected by the size and reflections of obvious affluence.
There is also a Silk museum although we did not have time to go to this.
Comfort wise, there are several places where you can sit and rest, and there are ample toilet facilities although you may have to queue. There are both Western and Eastern style toilets- at busy times you may have to queue.
All in all, the village is well worth a visit if you are in the area, and it certainly makes you appreciate what it would be like to live there in Winter time, when the villagers would be even more cut off. There are parking fees and to enter individual houses, charges apply. However you can wander round the village at no cost.
I would recommend looking at the Shirakawago tourist information website in order to check out bus information etc.",Tripadvisor

"Interesting castle, and it is basically authentic, unlike many of the castles in Japan, many of which are reconstructions after being destroyed by fire, earthquake, or war.

The grounds are free, if you don't feel the need to get up close to the castle. The most impressive views of the castle are actually from the free area. Unlike Osaka castle, however, where the grounds are also free, you don't really get a true idea of the size of this castle unless you pay the entrance fee and get up close.

The tourist information at the train station mentioned that there is a bus to the castle, and at 100 Yen it is excellent value. I walked back to the train station from the castle, as it really is not that far (15 minutes, 1.2 km), so either option for access is good.",Tripadvisor
"Most everything written about this already so wont repeat. All I will add is that I saw some reviews warning against going in to the castle. Please do yourself a favor and ignore those warnings. You would miss an experience you just cant get elsewhere, especially if you love history.
Make sure not to overlook the western bailey which was the living quarters. Great views of the castle keep.
Lines weren’t too bad for us. Did a day trip from Osaka, got to the castle approx 9.30am on a Tuesday. Had expected much worse crowds but weren’t held up at all. Needed about 2 hours before we moved on to Nara.

"新幹線で姫路駅に降り立つと、北へ向かう広い道路の真正面に白鷺城は見えています。荷物を山陽電鉄の姫路駅ロッカーに預け、観光名所マンホールも楽しみながら歩き出しましたが、炎天下では２０分のこの距離はおすすめしません。バスも走っています。
入城口から大天守までの道のりも他の城とは異なる複雑さで、まさに白亜の要塞を攻略しているかのようでした。最初に認識した門は「ろ」でした（その前にあったと思われるいの門は見過ごしました）が、その後出城口に近い「ぬ」までは見つけられました（るの門も見逃したようです）。
大天守の立派さは言うまでもありませんが、他の城の内部によくある展示物が置かれていないので、広さがより実感できました。とにかく規模が大きいのですが、小天守が連なる連立式天守も美しさを感じさせました。
最上階（六階）から眺めた姫路市街は、静岡（駿府）城下町になんとなく似ているような気がします。
出口へ向かう所に「腹切丸」という場所があり、此処で何人もが切腹をしたのかとゾッとしました。しかしそういう場所ではなく薄暗い雰囲気から名付けられただけのようでホッとしたのですが、その後通った「お菊井戸」は、お菊の亡霊が井戸で夜な夜な「一ま～い、二ま～い・・・」と皿を数えるあの怪談番町皿屋敷の元となった播州皿屋敷にまつわる井戸とのことで、再び肝を冷やしました。

Well worth the 1 hour train ride from Osaka! It is an easy walk from the Himeji train station. The castle is stunning with a very interesting history. There are I think 107 steps to the top but well worth it. I was lucky to get an English speaking guide Mr. Takumi Isamu when I entered and he explained the castle to me over 1.5 hours. He was so knowledgable and really just a great guy to spend time with. It was a free tour and it was just myself. Incredible experience!,Tripadvisor

関東地方は神奈川県から眺めるチャンスがいちばん多いのですが、山梨から見ても静岡から見ても、あるいは飛行機の機内から見下ろしても、この山の形は他と比べることのできない「すばらしい」造形だと思います。雪をかぶっても夏の黒山でもその気品は変わることがありません。,Tripadvisor

千本鳥居が有名な伏見稲荷大社なので、本殿でお参りして、千本鳥居をくぐり、稲荷山まで行かずに帰る人が多いです。せっかく伏見稲荷大社に来たのなら、時間と体力があれば、稲荷山に登ることをオススメします。稲荷山の入口は四ツ辻で、時計回りと反時計周りの2つの登山ルートがあります。どちらのルートも1周30分と書かれています。私たちが上った時計回りのルートは、山頂（233.8ｍ）の一ノ峰（上社神蹟）～二ノ峰（中社神蹟）～三ノ峰（下社神蹟）の順に回ります。ルートの要所要所には売店があり、休憩できます。実際に歩いた感覚としては、30分で周るためには、かなりハイペースで歩く必要があると思いました。とても暑い日だったので大変でしたが、楽しかったです。,Tripadvisor
"Lo avevamo già visto l'anno scorso di giorno ( veramente troppo caldo e troppa gente) ,invece quest'anno abbiamo deciso di andarci di sera.scelta perfetta, pochissima gente ed è veramente suggestivo con il buio",Tripadvisor
This was on my bucket list and did not disappoint. I was in awe with this incredible shrine. It was really hot and lots of tourists but the higher you go the thinner the crowd! I lived every minute of it. Yes we were very sweaty but hey it’s one day of being uncomfortable. Getting to experience this incredible shrine was a dream come true for me. Highly recommended!!,Tripadvisor

"日本の原風景を見たく、TV等の放映を見るたび、訪問を計画していたのが、今回ようやく実現しました。金沢駅前の北鉄バス営業所で事前予約の白川郷往復切符（なんと予約制です）を購入し、目の前のバス停から、乗ること（6名）およそ1.5時間ノンストップで白川郷に到着です。
平日の夏休み前の時期設定は正解と頷きずきながら、展望台の方を見ると疎らな人影。静かな眺望を期待しながら道すがら展望台に上っていくに従い、写真を撮る人達の嬌声で満ちて居り、予想外の展開にうろたえながらもその人ごみの間に入って眼下の集落を何とか見ることが出来ました。
そそくさと静けさを求め、重厚な合従造りの家々の見物に回りました。これら家々はすべて葦引きの厚みも違い、また屋根の形状も違い、
その重厚さとバランスの美しさに感激しましたが、期待していた集落全体像をもう少し見たかかったのが本心です。

テレビで見るので行きたいと思っていました。金沢から１時間２０分位で行けました。案外近かったです。夕方の飛行機で帰るので悩みましたが行って良かったです。二時間もあれば見て回れるのではないでしょうか、ゆっくりと時間がながれ水路には鯉と一緒に大きな鱒が泳いでました。あんなに大きな鱒は釣り堀でも見たことがありません 観光客の方は外国人が多い様に思いました。レンタカーで入ってきてしまうようです。外国の方には標識わかりづらいのでしょうか。火事を出さないように至るところに灰皿がありました。なかなか最近堂々とタバコが吸えるところはないので主人は喜んでいました。冬の雪景色も見てみたいです。,Tripadvisor
本來以為夏天的白川鄉比較不好看，但當天早上下雨，附近的山有一些薄霧，讓整個村莊好像添了一層仙氣。我們坐客運前往，必須先預約。沿途看到不少西方遊客，他們也好像覺得很特別。地方不大，兩三個小時已經可以逛完，但參觀個別農屋可能要多預留時間。,Tripadvisor

"one of the top, if not the top, attraction to visit in Kyoto. I arrived there about one hour after opening and the crowds were fine, it was an ok time to walk through the gates. however, I would not recommend arriving any later; get there as early as possible. others say that it is not necessary to continue to the top of the mountain (there is a break at the halfway point where you can return down). it was incredibly foggy so I did not continue upwards to the viewpoints. would absolutely recommend as the top site to see in Kyoto.",Tripadvisor
"It was so easy to make our way here using JR Nara line, and the station is just by the shrine’s entrance. This beautiful huge shrine (10,000 gates, 12,000 steps) was the sight I was most interested in visiting and it did not disappoint! It was quite magical to be walking through the gates and this was not diminished by the fact that we visited on quite a busy Saturday. At the start we were just walking with the crowds in a single file, but surprisingly everyone was quiet and it was still enjoyable. We found that it was easy to break off and wander along the outskirts of the complex, and then be alone walking through stretches of gates and into small shrines. A highlight of our trip!",Tripadvisor
"Een busreiziger van 50 minuten brengt je direct in Shirakawa go (ofwel Ogi Machi). Een klein dorp met ca. 600 inwoners en specifieke huizen met een enorm rieten dak. Als je op tijd bent, is het hier nog rustig. Maar later op de dag komen hier wel een aantal bussen met toeristen. Je kunt er lekker rondwandelen en deze huizen die voor het leeuwendeel bewoond zijn, hebben enorme rieten daken. Zeer bijzonder om te zien. Je kunt r rustig een tweetal uurtjes doorbrengen.

"Merupakan kunjungan kami yang kedua setelah kunjungan kami yang pertama pada saat musim panas.
Berangkat dan pulang masih sama yaitu dari Kanazawa dengan menggunakan Nohi Bus yang sudah dipesan secara online. Naik bis dari terminal bis stasiun Kanazawa yang terletak di East Exit dan menunggu di perhentian No.2. Perjalanan ke Shirakawa Go ditempuh dalam waktu 1 jam.
Kunjungan kami ke desa ini sangat mengharapkan turunnya salju, namun apa daya salju belum turun sampai dengan kunjungan kami.
Kalo sebelumnya kami menginap di desa ini dan menikmati suasana desa ini pada waktu malam, maka kunjungan kami kali ini menikmati suasana desa pada saat siang hari. Pada saat malam, suasana desa sunyi senyap tapi pada saat siang hari sangat ramai oleh wisatawan yang berkunjung. Untuk menikmati suasana desa ini, cukup 5 jam saja. Bis terakhir ke Kanazawa jam 16.50 sedangkan bis terakhir ke Takayama jam 18.50 dan pastikan pesan secara online.

Meskipun bukan tempat yang khusus disediakan untuk sholat, kami memperoleh tempat untuk melaksanakan sholat di rest area yang terletak di tengah-tengah desa. Ada restroom yang dapat digunakan untuk berwudhu.",Tripadvisor
10 000 toriis along the way to the top which is 6000 steps away so 12 000 altogether. It is a lovely walk and as further up you come the less people there is so keep it up because the view from the top and the feeling of ascending this holy mountain is well worth the steps.,Tripadvisor
"Shirakawa-Go is a UNESCO Heritage Site famous for their traditional Gassho-Zukuri Farmhouses. Basically the roof is constructed like hands in prayer. We spent 2 hours here as part of a Day Tour with Yokoso Japan. It gave us plenty of time to go to the Open Air Museum, walk up to the Observatory and walk around the Historic Village. Inside the Village, you will see examples of these farmhouses. However, the town is pretty touristy. Large buses came on a daily basis.

We came on January 4 and unfortunately there wasn't much snow. But I did enjoy walking around the town.",Tripadvisor

"We were in Kyoto for three days and one day we spent walking almost to the top of the gates. It is very, very crowded and you are walking on uneven surfaces up the steps. We stopped right before the final loop area and had a fantastic view of Kyoto. Definitely need to take water with you and I would recommend taking a snack with you. Yes, there are places along the walk to get water and snacks; however, the choices are limited. You can get some nice photos if you briefly step off the main path for the photo. The movement of the crowd through the gates comes to a complete stop a lot because people hold up the crowd to take their perfect photo without people in it.

You must have a lot of patience and be in decent shape if you plan to walk up to the top or near the top.

We took a bicycle tour the next day and it included a stop here. We were glad we spent most of the previous day here because it was definitely worth seeing and experiencing walking through all the gates. You should plan on spending 2-3 hours due to crowds. On the bicycle tour, we only walked up a little way, took photo ops and then left. Maybe there for 30 minutes which is not enough time. However, our bicycle tour guide gave us some wonderful background information about it which we did not get walking through the gates on our own.",Tripadvisor
"Whether you hate or tolerate mass tourism, this shrine and its aesthetic as we have it today need emptiness and space, especially from non-Japanese tourists, and that is almost impossible to come by - no. 1 here as Kyoto sight. So, take the earliest train from Kyoto Station that you can on the day you want to visit (it will not be early enough but still - buses make no sense and taxis are cher), get out and quickly walk up the trail, and you'll be guaranteed a few nice pix of the orange torij gate tunnels with nobody from Idaho. It is worth it, but I'd say primarily aesthetically and not spiritually - maybe it is me, but I found at least a dozen temples and shrines in Kyoto more powerful and a few even artistically or landscape-wise more pleasing. Some very nice amulets with the fox theme though!",Tripadvisor

"Sicuramente da visitare, luogo iconico e super fotografato.
Forse uno dei più famosi di Kyoto.
Molto bello e suggestivo, PERO' all'ingresso dei Torii c'è da spaventarsi dalle migliaia di persone accalcate per fare fotografie.
Fortunatamente avevo già letto ovunque che non bisogna demoralizzarsi, ma continuare a camminare. Il tunnel di Torii continua infatti per Km sulla montagna e, pian piano, l'orda di turisti vista all'inizio sparisce.
Tutti vogliono solo la foto in posa per Instagram e non hanno voglia di faticare ma, ovviamente, io consiglio di salire fino alla cima perchè ne vale la pena. Il percorso lungo la forsta è bellissimo, si trovano statue, altari e anche qualche bancarella di souvenir qua e la.
Una bellissima esperienza! Worth it",Tripadvisor
"Fusimi Inari Taisha is a Sinto Shrine, dedicated to the deity of good harvest and success in business. The Shrine was built in the year 711 before Kyoto became Japan's capital. The Shrine is famous for the presence of approximately 10000 Torii gates that gives the impression of an orange color tunnel. The Torii gates are donated by individuals and companies for prosperity in business.
Statues of foxes are everywhere in the temple as they are believed to be messengers of the deity Inari.
To walk through the whole Torii gate it may take about 3 hours or one can return after the first phase that may take about 30 min.
The temple complex is very beautiful with mountains, garden and many smaller temples all around. Visit to this temple should be part of Japan itinerary.",Tripadvisor
"È un santuario Shintoista dedicato a Inari, la divinità della prosperità.

Il posto si sviluppa lungo un monte che è possibile scalare in 2-3 orette, ci sono mappe e cartelloni ovunque quindi è impossibile perdersi.

Essendo metà turistica ai piedi della montagna noterete moltissima folla. Dato che li ci sono negozietti di souvenir vari poi si creano intasamenti un po’ casuali e fastidiosi. Man mano che si sale poi è impossibile non imbattersi in quei 2-3 Americani che con il loro improvvisato set fotografico intasano tutta la strada. Anche li pazienza, fidatevi: Più vi avvicinate alla vetta e più il percorso di screma di turisti li per aggiornare la bacheca social e si riempie di viaggiatori li perchè davvero interessati alla cultura e all’ambiente che il santuario offre.

Ci sono varie fermate lungo il tragitto. Per bagni, ma anche per altri souvenir o altari per preghiere. Di tanto in tanto ci sono anche panchine per sedersi o angolini dove prendere bibite da vending machines.

Per quanto riguarda il percorso in se’ in verità c’è ne sono due. Uno in senso orario (Che è quello panoramico, ma lungo) e uno in senso antiorario (Che è quello più rapido per la vetta, ma anche il più ripido). Scegliete voi quello che più vi aggrada.

Personalmente il panoramico l’ho preferito. Ci sono ruscelli, altari con riso e sake, statue di volpi, e tranquillità dato che molti puntano direttamente alla vetta per il selfie trofeo.

La vetta di per se è molto anticlimatica. Ci sono anche qui altari e statue ma nulla di emozionante. Turisti ovunque di nuovo affollati qua che scattano foto.

Per il resto la discesa è piacevole e se proseguite per l’incrocio secondario (Quello vicino al cartello non dare da mangiare a cinghiali e scimmie) finite in vicoletti caratteristici e altri negozietti.

Nel complesso bella esperienza. Se riuscite andate in orari di luce minuti di acqua e tanta volontà e pazienza.",Tripadvisor

Nonetheless, it is still a beautiful town with amazingly preserved historical houses.

"Went at lunch time and while it was crowded the tour guide kept remarking that it was not crowded at all as it usually is in the spring. The higher up you walk the less people you see. If you want good photos wait until the path curves and then you can get a picture with no other people in it. Besides the photo ops this place is beautiful and would be serene if not for all the people, myself included.",Tripadvisor
"Despite the crowds, I really liked this shrine. It's more than the red Tori gates. The shrine itself is really beautiful set high up on a hill and well-maintained. The landscaping was carefully thought out and there are strategically placed cherry blossom trees throughout the grounds to make the shrine even more picturesque and pleasing to visitors. Although I do wish it was less crowded, I am told if you get here early then there are less tourists. Regardless, no amount of people could take away from the shrine's beauty. Definitely worth a visit when in Kyoto. Also, don't forget to check out the many snack shops outside the shrine. I posted a photo of an apparently well-known mochi place a few doors down from the shrine. I regret not getting a dozen of those crunchy colorful mochi balls.",Tripadvisor
"We booked a light-up bus tour on February 2. My friends were disappointed that it wasn't snowing. Without snow, it probably would be better to come in spring. Also, we think that the light-up would be better appreciated on the observatory deck. Still, the place was beautiful and we wish we could have spent more time there during daytime.",Tripadvisor
今天總算來到名古屋的白川鄉合當掌屋，這屬於世界遺產的合掌村真是大開眼界，這裡的小屋全都是用木建造，屋頂設成斜角的正三角形，此時既可擋風又承載厚厚的積雪，每間屋的屋頂外形又如雙手合十，特別的木屋郡加上美麗的藍天白雲景色，真是世外桃源便成為遊客必到的地方，來自世界各國的人，共享這美麗的合掌村。,Tripadvisor
"We did this as part of an organised tour through our cruise line, where we docked in Osaka. It is about 90 mins from Osaka to the shrine and is extremely crowded. Lots of people had hired kimonos and looked absolutely stunning. Lots of shops and food stalls on route to the shrine. The shrine itself was amazing. There are lots of great photo opportunities, especially the 10000 Tori gates. Loved Kyoto, probably my favourite town in Japan.",Tripadvisor
"Outstanding experience. A tremendous shrine, well kept and tourist friendly. Allow at least 1/2 a day for a full experience.",Tripadvisor
"Very beautiful hidden village surrounded by mountains. It's reachable via Kanazawa, Nagoya, Toyama and maybe another city. The village itself is very small and very walkable, I suggest walking all around the village but please be mindful of the people who live there. Get your bus ticket early! We spent 5 hours exploring the village and it was plenty of time to explore all the streets of this village.",Tripadvisor

"たいへん有名な場所ですが、今回初訪問。
濃飛バスを利用しました。
高山市内から4,50分、特に渋滞などなくスムーズに到着。(バスは観光客、ほとんど外国人でした)
白川郷は大変賑わっていました。
この日は雪も降っていたので、タイ、ベトナムからの観光客は大はしゃぎのようでした。自分も雪を久し振りに見たので少しテンションが上がりました。。
ただ本当に人が多く、どこでもお構い無く写真撮影しているので、歩くのが大変でした。観光業に関与していない地元の方はいつもご苦労様です。
外国だとクラクションが鳴り止まないところですが、運転手は忍耐強く待ってました。思わぬところで日本らしさ？を再確認しました。笑
とても観光地化されていますが、めったにみることができない、建物、風景にとても満足しました。",Tripadvisor
"The village is as beautiful as the photos when it is snowing in the winter. At daytime, the tourists are overwhelming. I would recommend to spend a night here so that you are able to explore the areas after the last buses for the tourists have left and in early morning before the first buses arrive.

It takes about 30 minutes walk to the observatory as well as to the 3 houses often featured in the the photos, but they are at opposite side of the village.

This year it does not snow as much as other years so I was lucky to visit on a day when it was snowing. Visiting for snow in December is risky so consider to visit in late January.",Tripadvisor
"Top. Prachtig en zeer indrukwekkend. Loop ook zeker tot de top. Daar is het niet meer zo druk en intiemer.
Je moet wel goed te been zijn. Het zijn veel trappen lopen maar zeer de moeite waard. Er zijn mogelijkheden om wat te drinken of eten te kopen onderweg naar de top.",Tripadvisor
"We went on our own from Takayama. The round-trip bus fare was 4600 yen per person. We took a two-hour tour from a guide at the tourist information center that cost 1500 yen per person that included a visit to the Wada house. The visit to Shirakawa-go was the highlight of our visit to Takayama. Highly recommended. Note that many of the restaurants close early. We couldn’t find one that was still open at 3:00 pm. Some of the return buses have reserved seating, but you need to reserve early (like when you arrive). They had two buses (same company) that left at 4:15 pm, so they were able to accommodate everyone. I note that there was at least one tour that advertised their four-hour tour (our bus ride took about an hour) for less than what we paid, so that may be a better deal",Tripadvisor
"Our tour group from Inspiring Vacations Australia visited this area. It is an historical village and there are two houses that are open for viewing (at a small fee of 300 yen), for visitors. There are also cafes, restaurants and souvenir shops throughout the village. In winter, this area is snowbound, however, in good weather it is a photographer's dream with the vast array of steep thatched roof houses throughout the village. A short walk away, up the hillside, allows visitors to photograph the entire area. There is a constant sound of running water from the many deep drains that run throughout the complex, with pristine water running down the mountainside.",Tripadvisor
"This is definitely a must when you visit Kyoto, a little out of the way but well worth the effort. We managed to see a small ritual, which added to the whole experience. It was a very hot so did not make it to the top of the mountain, but still a great experience. Walking through the tori gates is very inspiring.",Tripadvisor
"Amazed at the rave reviews. It is interesting to get off the bus between Takayama and Kanazawa and stroll through this preserved village, with stops at museums and preserved houses, but it is not a ""must see."" You do not have to cross every UNESCO site off your bucket list. It might be even more interesting to stay here and get a ""when-the-tourists-leave"" feel in the evenings. We were happy to learn there is ample luggage storage in a little house just behind the bus station for a fee. Prices in shops here are higher than elsewhere.",Tripadvisor

"We were there on Sunday afternoon, it was packed.

We drive from Takayama and need to park on the mountain car park. It has free shuttle bus (include in the parking fee).

The last bus ride from the far end of the village up to the view point is 3.40 pm. and unfortunately, we missed it.

So taking 1 hour walk around and visit an old house. Need to run again because the last shuttle back to the car park is 5.00 pm.

Overall, it is a nice and beautiful village.",Tripadvisor
"Shirakawa-Go ist einen Ausflug wert. Allerdings sollte man für die Zeit in Shirakawa lediglich 2h einplanen. Die Hin-und Rückfahrt dauern jeweils ca. 1h mit dem Bus, der sich am Kanazawa Hauptbahnhof buchen lässt. Die Fahrtzeit ist abhängig von den möglichen Zwischenstopps.
Ein Trip nach Shirakawa-Go kostet ca 30€ pro Person.

"As is pretty typical, shops selling food, souvenirs, clothes, and more line the road to the entrance to this popular shrine. Starting at $4000 each, businessmen have donated 10,000 of vermillion gates to honor Inari, the diety of rice and sake. This shrine is in a sake-making district. There is a path through the gates, which is interesting to walk through that leads to the forest of the sacred Mount Inari. One need not walk the entire length as there are sections where one can return to the starting place. At one of the stops is Omokaru-ishi, a stone for fortune-telling. If you can lift the stone, you are vigorous. Must be a lot of vigorous visitors.
Note the Japanese lettering on each torii about the donation of it.
The main hall is huge and when we were there for the once-a-year Cherry Blossom Festival on April 7, 2024, there were elaborate ceremonies in the main shrine hall. This is the Head shrine of the Inari shrines. There is prayer for light and prosperity and protector of Samurai warriors. We were here for 3 hours.",Tripadvisor

　迷いましたが、まずはシャトルバスに乗り展望台から集落全体を眺めることを選択。和田家の前から出ている200円のシャトルバスに乗って展望台へ。景色を眺めてゆっくりしたい気持ちを抑えながら、帰りは早歩きで10分余りほど下り和田家へ。そのあとは集合時間内でお団子を買ったりとあっという間の白川郷でした。観光化は予想の範囲内。合掌造りの家を維持していく大変さと大事さを痛感したので仕方のないことだと思いました。ぜひ大事にして頂きたいです。

"白川郷へはJR高山駅のすぐ横の、バスセンターからバスが出ており、往復のバス代と民家園の入場券がセットで4800円というお得なチケットを購入して行きました。高山駅からは1時間半ほどかかります。村は意外と広く、一周するとかなり時間がかかるため、17時半の最終バスに間に合わせるには2時間前までには着く事をお勧めします。

"on a recommendation, we made a stop at Shirakawa-go on the way from Takayama to Kanazawa - using Highway bus.

The bus station feels a little in the middle of nowhere, and option from there is a walk up the hill, or the shuttle bus that drops you at the top, which gives a lovely view over the village where you can see the many houses in the Gassho style.
Following the crowds, the walk back down into the village takes you past many example of the houses to see up close, and a pay-on-entry museum which has limited information in English, but it is possible to understand what is being shared.

Continue the walk through the village, with plenty of small snack stations to try local dishes, and enjoy what should be a peaceful village. However there are a number of tour buses regularly bringin in groups, and as the Highway bus runs fairly regularly this also leads to fairly sizable number of tourists. Expect the buses to be busy

worth a visit, and a good way to break up any journey between Takayama and Kanazawa",Tripadvisor
"Storico villaggio situato sulle montagne giapponesi, dal 1995 è stato dichiarato patrimonio mondiale dell’UNESCO, sono infatti presenti più di 200 case gassho-zukuri tradizionali importantissime culturalmente. La parte dove sono presenti tutte le case si chiama Ogimachi. Noi siamo stati in estate, fa caldo ma i colori delle risaie intorno sono di un verde brillante stupendo (i colori ricordano quasi le risaie di Tegalalang a Bali).
Il paese è pieno di attività locali con ottimi ristoranti. Vi consiglio di dedicare almeno una giornata.
È molto facile da raggiungere, noi abbiamo preso un autobus dalla stazione di Kanazawa e in 50 min siamo arrivati, al ritorno siamo andati a Takayama, che sono sempre 50 minuti di viaggio.",Tripadvisor
"We visited on a guided day trip from Takayama. Beautiful scenery, traditional lunch on arrival and easy to navigate our way around the area. Not too crowded either. Highly recommend.",Tripadvisor
"The shrine is a must-visit when you visit Kyoto. The shrine is situated on a mountain and it takes about 1.5 to 2 hours to get to the top of the mountain. You walk through a tunnel of toriis as you climb to the top. The tunnel of toriis is a sight to behold. Each torii were donated by corporations throughout Japan and bear their names and addresses on them. Although it was low-season for domestic tourists, there were many students from school trips and foreign tourists.",Tripadvisor
"Absolutely stunningly beautiful forest with pathways up the mountain, guided by thousands of orange Tori gates.
There are so many tourists at the base of this site, but as you climb higher and higher up the mountain to the top, the numbers thin out allowing you to appreciate the space and beauty of this special location",Tripadvisor
"This place is simply AMAZING
We were fortunate enough to be driven by a dear friend from Takayama
However, there are quite a few day trips from Nagoya and Tokyo to Shirakawa-go
It is simply breathtaking from the hilltop and then when you actually get into the village it is like stepping back in time
Felt like intruders when we first stepped into the village but everyone here is lovely. We spent 2 to 3 hours just wandering and had a simple noodles meal at one of the cafes.
You can pay 400yen and enter one of the display houses. It certainly is a beautiful experience. Even my 16 year old was enthralled. They have everything from cutlery to tools to furniture dating back to the years gone by
So happy we took the time to visit Shirakawa-go
We left with beautiful memories and pictures",Tripadvisor

"Must-do when in Kyoto. Very impressive walk along thousands of toris. Even when you think it's the end, the toris still continue. Recommended to go there early morning (we were there at 7:30 am and could take pictures with nobody else on the photo). When we left around 9/9:30 am everything was crowded.",Tripadvisor
This place is enchanting! The area has so many different paths leading to different shrines. You could wander for hours! Beautiful.,Tripadvisor
"Do not miss this lovely walk through the thousands of orange torii gates around Mt.Inari. It is truly an amazing experience.
The concrete path is shaded for most of the journey and there’s plenty of places to stop for drinks, food & souvenirs. There’s also hundreds of great photo opportunities everywhere throughout the 2 to 3 hour walk. Whilst the path is up & down & with steep steps in places the walk is relatively easy for any person who is mobile.
Best of all you can take some stunning photos off the beaten tracks in & around the bamboo forests surrounding the torii path.
It’s no wonder this is Kyoto’s number one attraction.",Tripadvisor
Picturesque Little Village with an interesting history back to the Edo period. Amazing straw roof and architecture.,Tripadvisor
"A must see when in Kyoto. We opted for this instead of the bamboo walk. After an early dinner, we decided to visit this shrine at night (thinking that it wouldn't be as crowded). There were quite a few people during the evening hours but I imagine that it would be super crowded during the day. The evening gave the temple a mysterious glow. I liked visiting at night. It was a little spooky going through the gates although we only went to the first ""substation.",Tripadvisor

"Given that this part of the village showcases the gasshō-zukuri buildings, it was surprisingly quiet, although you do have to pay to enter and it was late on in the afternoon, so visitors may have already left. You can go into the buildings (remember to remove your shoes) and see how they were constructed.",Tripadvisor
"This is a magical place consisting of the main shrine and a number of smaller shrines at the base of Mt. Inari and, then, as you climb, many more shrines, viewpoints and tea houses accessed through a trail framed by hundreds of red archways/gates for a good part of the way. The trail eventually turns to stairs. The hike is steep and not particularly accessible for people with mobility issues, but if you are fit and patient, its one of the best things to do in Kyoto. It will take you 2-3 hours to navigate everything. Just outside the temple there is a large market area in the Inari neighborhood which is also lovely, and there are a ton of food stalls there if you want to eat. Be mindful of people who have come to the various shrines to pray (i.e., it was kind of uncomfortable watching tourists take photos of people at worship), and wear comfy shoes. We got there at around 10:00am during Golden Week and the crowds were so dense that the initial 200-300m of the path was at a standstill. I have never really been in a traffic jam of people before...and this part wasn't so nice...so get there early and preferably not during a national holiday. Otherwise, Fushimi Inari, the mountain, and the neighborhood around are must-see landmarks in Kyoto.",Tripadvisor

"Beautiful village and a great place to explore. The 600yen entrance ticket also enabled us to go back at night to view the village when it is lighted up. So remember to keep your tickets. A gassho style house is a house with thatched, gabled roof constructed with a Japanese style truss like roof system. The form of the house was required as a silkworm farm but nowadays there is no more silkworm cultivation but tourism being carried out in the village. There are many houses to visit . Before entering the house, one must take off the shoes. One can see the shrine hall, the dining hall, the kitchen, the bedrooms, the toilet, the storage shed, the place where horses were kept. There is the house labeled number 6 on the guide where a man shows how to make straw slippers. Interesting to watch. Also look out for the water mill, watch tower, rice drying shed, mortar shed , waterfall, and a shrine. One can have free tea, sitting around the warming fire, to have a rest before continuing. There are also many shops to buy souvenirs, cookies, clothings. There are also restaurants to have food. While walking through the village, do enjoy the sight of the wild plants.",Tripadvisor

新幹線姫路駅から真正面北側に姫路城が有りました。駅からお城まで真っ直ぐな広い道が続いており、その先に白く輝く大天守白鷺城が望める風景に感動することでしょう。世界文化遺産の姫路城は築城時そのままの姿で、太平洋戦争の空襲にも焼失を免れたお城です。米国は価値のある美しいお城の焼失を回避したとの見方もあります。開門は９時ですが、開門前から長い列が出来ていました。お城に入るまでいくつもの門を通り、お城に入ってからも大天守まで結構時間が掛かり、最短１時間は必要です。日本中のお城全てに共通する造りなのですが、矢張り高さ広さの規模が格段に違います。また、一番の特徴はその美しさにあります。何処から見ても最高の被写体でした。機会があれば是非ともおススメの姫路城です。,Tripadvisor

"Subi o Fuji em Agosto. Verifique as datas pois o Fuji fica fechado para subida boa parte do ano. São várias rotas. Eu escolhi a Fujinomiya. Na Estação de trem Fujinomiya vc encontra os ônibus que levam à 5a estação, que fica a altitude de 2400 m, daí pra frente é só subida, essa rota é de dificuldade média, de piso bem irregular. São várias estações até o topo, onde vc pode parar para descansar, comprar algo para comer e beber e observar a paisagem. No início da subida vc pode comprar um bastão para auxiliar na subida, e em cada estação, carimbar o bastão. Subi sozinho e levei 5 horas até o topo, para descer levei 4 horas. Iniciei a subida as 10 h da manhã e cheguei ao topo as 3 h da tarde. Preferi subir e descer no mesmo dia, mas vc pode passar a noite lá em cima, procure na internet vagas nas estações para passar a noite. Os ônibus aguardam os turistas até as 19 h, depois disso não há mais transporte para as estações de trem “pelo menos nessa rota”. Depois das 19 h vc não encontra mais nada aberto na base de saída “5a estação”, então o planejamento é fundamental. É desgastante, não sou atleta mas subi bem com um esforço extra, no caminho as pessoas dizem “ Konichiwa” que é um cumprimento e “Gambatê!” que em japonês quer dizer “Força!”. Não é fácil, mas vale cada metro que vc sobe, é algo que fica marcado na sua vida. Boa subida!",Tripadvisor
"　羽田発石垣行きの飛行機は、富士山の南側を通って西へ向かっていました。離陸後は、眼下に雲が広がっていて、地上はあまり見えない状況でした。そんな中で、富士山が、雲の中から頭だけ出している姿を見ることができました。

ตอนไปเที่ยว เลือกที่จะเช่ารถขับไป ซึ่งเป็นการตัดสินใจที่ถูกต้องอย่างยิ่งค่ะ ขาไปใช้เวลาเกือบ 4 ชั่วโมง รถติดเอาเรื่องค่ะ ขับรถไม่ยาก อยากจะแวะจอดถ่ายรูปที่ไหนก็ได้ค่ะ เพราะคนไปเที่ยวกันเยอะมาก ถ้ารอรถบัส ดูแล้วแถวยาวมากค่ะ ยืนรอเมื่อยแน่นอน,Tripadvisor
"Vi bokade bussresa till Fuji via Japan panoramic Tours och det var ett lyckat drag. Bra ordnat med det bästa av det mesta som Fuji kan leverera. Vädret var med oss och berget glittrade som guld i höstsolen. Att se Fuji spegla sig i sjön vid bergets fot måste upplevas likaså att stå på 2500 meters höjd och låta molnen forma sig under ens fötter. Ja, man känner sig vördnadsfull inför all denna prakt!",Tripadvisor

"９月６日〜７日に弾丸登頂してきました。
新宿バスタから河口湖駅を経由してスバルライン五合目へ。河口湖から五合目までのバスは補助席を使うどころか乗れない人が出るくらいの満席。しかもそのうちの９割が外国人。隣の補助席に座ったのはフランス人🇫🇷の青年グループ。本当にここは日本？という感じ。
１９時過ぎに五合目に着いて無料休憩所で待機。ここにも外国人がたくさん。隣にいたのはドイツ人🇩🇪の青年ふたり。
２０時半に登山開始。登山のはずがしばらくは下り坂。この道で合ってる？と聞いてくる外国人女性もいたほど。
登山中もケニア人🇰🇪など、もう多国籍軍。空は満天の星空でご来光☀️への期待が膨らむ。
九合目を過ぎると一列に並んでの行軍状態。それでも隙あらば追い越しをかけてくる某国人が後を絶たなかったのが少し残念。この間の落石事故のことを知らないのだろうか？
とにかく苦行とも思える歩みを進め、もう少しで頂上と言う鳥居⛩＆狛犬の手前でご来光を待つことに。
後で頂上のお店の人に聞いても今日のご来光☀️は特に綺麗だったとのこと。感激のあまり泣きそうになった。
その後も頂上で居合わせたドイツ人🇩🇪女生とも喜びを分かち合った。
お鉢周りを反時計回りに回り、伊豆半島が伊豆半島に見えない角度での景色に驚き、剣ヶ峰に行こうとしたら反対側に行列ができていて残念。でも、３０分待ちの末に日本の最高点に到達！おにぎり🍙を食べた。
お鉢周りの後は下山。これが登り以上の苦行。砂利に滑って２回も転んでしまった。スキーするにはいい感じの斜面だが、砂埃も酷く、疲労困憊。
下山後は温泉に入り、ほうとうを食べて帰宅。２日間トータルで40,000歩も歩いたが、満足のいく富士🗻登山であった。",Tripadvisor
"夏目漱石は「三四郎」でこのように述べている。「あなたは東京がはじめてなら、まだ富士山を見たことがないでしょう。今に見えるから御覧なさい。あれが日本一の名物だ。あれよりほかに自慢するものは何もない。」卑しくも日本で登山を愛好するものであれば、日本一の山である富士山に登ってみたいと思うものであろう。ゆえに登ってみた。

とはいえ僕は熟練の登山家ではない。3,000 m 峰を登ったことすらなく、高山病に怯える哀れな初心者である。にも関わらず吉田ルートを北口本宮冨士浅間神社から登り、山小屋に宿泊することなく下山、一日で登山を終えたいと考えていた。自分の脚力では半日以上を要するであろうと考え、まして初富士山であるから余裕をもって 5 日を用意した。

初日は 5 合目まで登り、所要時間や荷物の加減について調査を行った。その結果をもとに早速 2 日目に登頂を目指すも途中で体調不良のため断念。3 日目、4 日目は台風のため行動時間が限定され、6 合目までのウォームアップとした。最後の 5 日目、気負わずにはいられない。プレッシャーを抱えて登り始めた。序盤のペースは大変良い。

実はこの 5 日目にも様々なアクシデントがあったのだが、それはまあいいだろう。6 合目からは臆病なほどに呼吸を意識して登り続け、8 時間かけて剣ヶ峰に到着することができた。日本でここより高い場所はない。いま自分は日本で一番高い地表に立っている。その実感は素晴らしいものであった。これよりほかに自慢するものは何もない。",Tripadvisor
"Vi kørte op til 5. station, som er den sidste man kan køre til. Der var et mylder af mennesker og en del souvenirbutikker, men desværre ingen udsigt denne dag på grund af skyer.
Måske var det også præget lidt af at det var sidste weekend i år, hvor man kunne hike op til toppen, så det var virkelig et mylder.

"Habitué de la montagne mais pas non plus très grand sportif, il m'a fallu 4h30 pour monter et 1h40 pour descendre (comptez nettement plus si vous n'avez jamais fait de telles randonnées).

L'ascension par la Subashiri Trail (couleur rouge) n'est pas simple mais, et c'est assez rare pour être mentionné, la descente l'est. En effet, le chemin pour redescendre n'est pas le même et il est bien adapté (pente assez raide dans les cendres où on peut 'se laisser glisser').

Je la conseille donc pour les personnes qui veulent faire une première randonnée conséquente, car c'est assez rare d'avoir une descente simple, en principe c'est la partie la plus compliquée.",Tripadvisor

"A super huge forest city and good for family to spend time for picnic and playing outdoor. Also a nice place for couples to spend their time positively because the place is also quite romantic.
If you like taking a selvie or taking some pictures, this is the place for it. The best time of all to come is in SAKURA SEASON (end of March to early April).
What I like most is THE OXYGEN, refreshing!!!!",Tripadvisor
"You must include a visit to these exquisite gardens when visiting the Shinjuku area of Tokyo. In fact, this was one of my highlights of the entirety of Tokyo. You'll want to spend around 1.5 hours here. Beautiful!",Tripadvisor
"This was one of the best gardens we went to after Kenroku-en and Rikugien. It is a paradise in the heart of Tokyo, a refuge from the busy urban streets. The entrance fee is minimal (about £2.50) and it's a huge site. There were an abundance of flowering cherry trees, and really beautifully maintained and manicured shrubs and trees.

The Japanese garden and the Taiwainese pavilion were also highlights.",Tripadvisor
Beautiful garden. Great place to have picnic with family it is peaceful. Very Clean and well maintained the place. Worth the visit,Tripadvisor
"We took the train to Sendagaya station. On exiting the station turned right and walked past Excelsior cafe. We walked through the first underpass across the carpark below the train track and turned right. The Sendagaya entrance is just ahead and it is about 5 mins walk. Normally this park is closed on Monday but during the cherry blooming season, we could visit it on a Monday. This park is very peaceful and provides a good break from the city atmosphere. We also went into the Greenhouse.",Tripadvisor
Although the day we went was a warm Friday during Golden Week we were able to go about the park without feeling crowded. The grounds are just beautiful and so peaceful.

"I was here during Sakura and amazingly it was not too crowded (there were lots of people but it wasn’t nearly as bad as other spots in Tokyo were). There is a small cost to get in, but it was worth it. Different types of gardens are inside and a greenhouse. I spent about an hour in the late afternoon, but easily could’ve spent half a day. This was a he eat respite from the hustle of the city.",Tripadvisor

Beautiful National Garden in the center of Shinjuku. Great to provide shade on a warm sunny day. Worth spending at least an hour in it,Tripadvisor
"What an oasis in the midst of busy Tokyo. We were fortunate to visit during the cherry blossom season, when the garden was frequented by locals enjoying the blossoms and spring climate. Especially in the Japanese Garden area, people picnic on blankets laid on the grass amidst the trees,. Young and old frolicked among the stone lanterns, trees, ponds, Taiwan Pavilion and other garden areas, while birds flew and chirped. Wonderful place. Tickets are required before entry.",Tripadvisor

"The most beautiful park in Japan in my opinion, I went on a rainy day and it reminded me a lot of the atmosphere of the film Kotonoha no Niwa by Makoto Shinkai, it's a shame that when the rain got heavier I had to leave, but the little time I spent there was magical, I went back on a sunny day and it lost a bit of its charm, but it's still extremely beautiful.",Tripadvisor

"Sadly the cherry trees weren't in full blossom when I visited but it was still a nice garden. I had to wait an extra hour however because there were reservations needed for that day (which I had no idea about), and due to all the people the reservations were sold out so I had to wait until 4pm to go in the non-reservation period.",Tripadvisor
"Best cherry blossoms spot in all of Tokyo. Wonderful experience, make sure you get a ticket before it's all sold out. This is better than Ueno park, actually!",Tripadvisor
"Ein riesiger Park ist das, mit vielen einzelnen Sehenswürdigkeiten, z.B. die Pappelallee, der Rosengarten, der Taiwan-Pavilion und natürlich das Gewächshaus. Aber darüber hinaus bietet sich hier - vor allem an Wochenenden und Feiertagen - die Gelegenheit, das Familienleben der Japaner zu studieren, z.B. die Kleinfamilien beim Picknick auf dem Rasen, oder die Enkel-Großeltern-Eltern-Gruppen mit ihrer besonderen Dynamik beim Spielen.
Es lohnt sich, einfach mal eine Bank in Beschlag zu nehmen und zu beobachten, bevor man wieder aufbricht zu einem Rundgang durch lauschige Parkteile, am See entlang",Tripadvisor
"Como es conocido, Tokio es la ciudad más populosa del mundo, con mas de 30 millones de habitantes. Y es justamente por esta razón que la ciudad necesita islas de tranquilidad y sosiego para abstraerse de la vorágine. Este maravilloso y muy hermoso parque consigue justamente esto. Es un oasis de tranquilidad que se inscribe además con el sintoismo que valora mucho el contacto y respeto con la naturaleza. Aqui no escucharás ruidos citadinos,sino que escucharás como el viento habla con los árboles.

Was able to walk around the park and then crash in the grass to read my book. Beautiful place.",Tripadvisor

"Very nice park, easy to get to on train.
Well kept, the Japanese Garden was a highlight, plus there was a stunning chrysanthemum display on during my visit.

I went there with the hope of seeing the Sakura blossoms but no luck as only a few trees had sakuras blooming on them.

There is really nothing much this park. If anyone has visited the Botanical Gardens in Singapore, then you will definitely find this such an underwhelming place.

I definitely do not recommend this as a must do in any Tokyo itinerary.",Tripadvisor

Beautiful garden to walk around. We were here for cherry blossom season so it was busy and there were so many beautiful trees. If you do go here for this season make sure to check online as some days you may have to book a ticket online as it’s so busy. There was a Queue but it moved quite fast and you can also pay by using your Suica card. Be sure to give yourself enough time to walk around as we only did some of it not it all as we did not have enough time. It’s really nice to have a garden picnic if you’ve time.,Tripadvisor

När vi startade var det regnigt och rejält blåsigt. Från sjunde till nionde stationen så sprack det upp och blev sol.På toppen var det dimma, kallt och blåsigt. Vandringen var ganska ansträngande (två damer, 56 år ) och sista biten var det ganska påfrestande med höjden, hjärtat slog och det dunkade i huvudet. Vi tog små pauser hela tiden. Fanns mat och dryck att köpa på alla stationer på vägen upp, men inget på vägen tillbaka ( man vandrar ner en annan väg ). Vi valde att gå tider då det inte är så mycket folk, vilket kan rekommenderas om man orkar gå allt på en dag. De flesta går upp på eftermiddagen till 8th station och övernattar.

Je me suis mal préparée et j.ai écouté un ami de 26 ans qui l'avait fait dans la journée sans me dire vraiment à quoi je étais m'attendre. En effet, le départ est agréable, au bout de 30 minutes, on commence à monter c'est tout à fait faisable, mais c'est après que cela se corse, il faut grimper dans des rochers et ce n'est que de la montée, avec beaucoup de monde à la queue leu leu, Au bout de 3 heures, épuisée par le décalage horaire du voyage, essoufflée, nous avons joué la prudence et décidé de redescendre..donc pour des personnes d'un certain âge, ce n'est pas une sinécure.",Tripadvisor
"In general, fun rides and clean places. All the bathrooms and restaurants are clean and tidy. However the reason is not 5 stars is because there was one staff on “Stars Tour” for priority line around 11-1 pm on November 28th was very rude and had got some rasist or nationalist attitude.
Ms. Nakaya - I had to look at her name tag because she raised her vocie to me from the beginning when we wanted to pass the priority line. My daughter and I didn’t understand Japanese but she kept speaking only Japanese and yelled at us when I requested to speak “ English “ for us to understand.
My bad was that I literally didn’t understand her Japanese to ask my daughter to check her height to get in. She kept speaking and making gestures of removing my daughter from the entrance areas without even eye contact. Then she turned her back from us and walked away. I had to ask if she can speak English to explain? Then she yelled at us “ Japanese Only!”
Even though she only moved with a few steps, there was what she wanted us to do and finally I got to see a height measuring chart. I started feeling upset with her attitude and tones of voice without any eye contact or efforts that she tried to make us to understand. Except her, there were pretty much nice workers to help us understand every time we rode rides even if not many of them could speak English. Universal body languages simply worked because they
Showed us what we are supposed todo.
But Ms. Nakaya yelled at us two times about “ Speak Japanese Only” and tapping so hard the bar codes reader with her two fingers with very nasty attitude. I don’t know what it was about but she was giving us bad look and stinky attitude to make feel super unwelcome. She wasn’t having a bad day when i was going to go through the priority entrance because she was laughing and talking g with her other co workers just then. I felt so violent with her actions and even my very you g daughter - it kept us not having fun almost for a fee hours with that unpleasant experience. I felt it was super nationalism and racism. It must have been. We felt with our skin from her attitude and violent actions even verbally. That really ruined my experience with Japanese trip. Other than that, we really thought how wonderful Japanese people in general and lovely city and Disneyland in Tokyo.",Tripadvisor
"We visited Disney for 2 days with our 4yo son and it was an amazing experience. The park was spotless, efficient and welcoming. While the wait for some rides can be extensive (over an hour for popular rides), the wait is quickly forgotten once you are on them.

There is a good number of food options at surprisingly reasonable prices and getting there is easy by rail. You need at least 2 days to experience most of the park.

All of the ride commentary is in Japanese, which is worth noting, but didn’t really impact our experience as English speakers.",Tripadvisor
"One day is enough but you may want to consider taking two days to see everything in the park as wait times for the popular attractions can easily go to 100 minutes or more. When we visited in late December we simply did not have enough time to queue in the park for a few of the rides but prioritized our favourites including the Haunted Mansion with a seasonal overlay featuring the Nightmare Before Christmas.

The food options are plentiful and affordable at this Disneyland and you can get a full set meal for 1500 yen or less. There are lots of snack items too and our favourite item here is the flavour variety for the popcorn including the soy butter and milk tea flavours. Drinks and souvenirs are also reasonably priced and they even have a solid selection of alcoholic drinks to enjoy. If you don't have mouse ears yet this might be the best park to do it as many are around 1900 yen and the rest of the parks can easily cost twice as much! We didn't see many exclusives or must buys but the shop at the Disneyland Hotel has some nice souvenirs all in the same area and the Bon Voyage store just outside of Disneyland has the best variety and selection and it is open later.

One of our favourite features of this park is the way people coordinate their clothes to match with their friends, colour match with their headbands or dress as couples. It makes people watching that much more enjoyable. The staff are all super friendly and take pride in being helpful and knowledgeable.

We appreciated the priority pass and were able to use it for three rides during our stay but we found options were limited and most sold out before noon. These greatly reduce the wait times and it might be worth monitoring the wait times at the park leading up to when you go to decide what passes to get and which rides to prioritize to minimize your time standing in line. There are entry request passes for the shows but these were reserved quickly. We found as long as you show up 20 minutes before shows you should be able to get in and we felt the Mickey's Magical Music World show was absolutely worth it.

We caught all the outdoor shows and the Electrical Parade Dreamlights is easily the best and most unique parade we've seen at Disney parks. The Harmony and Colour parade was kind of small and we felt it was a little underwhelming for a Disney parade. The nighttime Sky Full of Colours is cool if you like fireworks. The castle changes colours but nothing like the incredible projections you'll see in Shanghai or Euro Disney. The fireworks songs and launch point is the same at both Disneyland and Disneysea so if you're doing both parks it might just be worth seeing once and prioritizing the other things at Disney you enjoy.

Getting to the park is easy and if you stay in the Urayasu area there is a good chance your hotel offers a shuttle to and from both parks. There are huge queues that form early at the park gates and we felt the shuttle at our hotel did not leave early enough and used the frequent bus system to get to the park for around 8 am and we got into the park at 8:55 am. We prioritized sleep and would consider lining up earlier to get into the park before line queues get out of hand. The Maihama Metro station is the closest for Metro and is JR if you get the JR Pass but if not the Kitaca pass is a great time saver for taking nearly all the busses and metros in Japan.

One item the park could improve on is bathroom maintenance and garbage can accessibility. Some bathrooms were surprisingly smelly and wet for a Disney park and we were surprised finding garbage left behind in queues. We also found several hand sanitizer dispensers that had ""out of order"" signs on them - we were curious if they were broken or should simply be removed or replaced. They could improve garbage can placement or have more than one per queue line so people could responsibly dispose instead of dumping.

Tickets for this Disneyland are typically only available a couple of months out and can sell out quickly so if you do want to experience this Disney it is worth booking as soon as you can.",Tripadvisor
"Big, great, nice,paradise show at the end.
Tickets $100 + depending on the days.
Very big , come early n finish late at 9pm.

"息子二人の家族と総勢9名でクリスマスのディズニーランドを堪能してきました。
この時期に訪問するのは20年ぶりくらいかも。
コロナ以前と比べると、人は少な目で行列もそれほどではありませんでした。

美女と野獣だけは1歳～4歳の子供たちが長く行列に並べないので、プレミアアクセスで入り、正解でした。

夕食のレストランはクリスタルパレスレストラン、こちらもプライオリティ・シーティング（優先予約）をとりました。思った以上に美味しいお料理で、大人も子供も大満足でした。
人数が多いので予約をしておけば安心、入園してすぐに30分かけてスマホアクセスです。

"I really wasn't sold on the whole Disneyland thing but from the moment we arrived it was a truly amazing experience. Everything was intentional and organised and held to the absolute highest standard. The food was great. Everything was reasonably priced (for an amusement park). The rides were great! Especially Space Mountain. The parade was excellent. Really no complaints. A great day out.

Some recommendations:
Bring snacks because the lines can be ridiculous even for food and you don't want to get hangry.

Wear sunscreen because you'll be in the sun a lot.

If it's winter - bring an extra layer! That winter wind is brutal by the coast. It was positively freezing for us Aussies.

Don't be put off by long wait times for rides - it's so efficient and organised that the time flew by. Only the bigger thrill rides dragged a bit in the lines but they were worth it.

Get in early - we were there from 9am to 9pm and only just managed to get through the Disney park. If you are going to attempt Disney and Disney Sea all at once I'd say stay in the resort and do it over two days. It's huge!

Oh and bring comfy shoes because you'll be on your feet for 12 hours.

Have fun!",Tripadvisor
"What you would expect from Disney. Friendly staff, great rides, lots of ppl & long lines. The app was very helpful to know the wait times. Food was a great, affordable price (I was shocked).",Tripadvisor
"アトラクションが色々増えて楽しい反面、入場料などがかなり値上がっているのに見合わず割り込む客やマナーの悪い方が増え過ぎです。
もっと入場制限をしたり、細かい場所にもロープを張って列を作るなど工夫が必要だと思います。
一部アトラクションではせっかく並んでいても中でぐちゃぐちゃに一箇所にまとめられまた並び直すタイプがありますが、最初から最後まで一列で進めるようにした方がトラブルは減るはずです。

蒸気船マークトウェイン号に並んでいる際に、赤ちゃんを抱っこした男性から赤ちゃんの足をバンバン当てながら割り込みされそうになりました。振り向くとやめましたが、謝ってもきませんでした。
美女と野獣のアトラクションで説明のプレショーを一番前で見ていた所、後ろからやってきた家族の子供がまだ一番前の端の方は空いているのにわざわざ隣の女性達の場所に割り込もうとしていました。（その女性達も露出が多く場にふさわしくない感じでしたが）
親が止めないので結局その女性達はその子供に場所を譲っていましたが、その子供は野獣が出てきた途端大泣き。
途中退場するのかと思いきやそのままアトラクションに乗り始終ずーっと泣いていたので全く説明などは聞こえず周りも冷ややかに見ていました。
他のアトラクションでは子供がずっと泣いている場合スタッフが退出を促していました。
その後ホーンテッドマンションでは周りの客に体当たりしながら割り込んでいく小学校高学年くらいの女子3人組がおり、割り込みを注意されずに育つといずれこうなるんだろうなと。
他にもスターウォーズで並んでいてぶつかっても謝らない外国人客や「Excuse me!」と嫌味な言い方で日本人客に道を開けさせる外国人客など挙げ出したらキリがないほどです。
常識や日本のマナーを守れる人だけ来てほしい。",Tripadvisor
"Tokyo Disneyland is a blast. We have an annual pass for Disneyland in CA so we do Disney a lot, but on our way home from Singapore, we stopped for a few days in Japan, and had to spend 2 days at the Tokyo Disney resort. The tickets were about $60 a day per person which is a steal compared to $100+ for Disneyland US. However, just like Disneyland, you can spend extra for the perk like lightning lane called Disney Premier Access or DPA, which lets you choose a time to stand in a shorter line for a ride (if available), or get assigned seats for a show. At Tokyo Disneyland, we only bought 1 DPA, that was for the Electrical Parade Dreamlights show. We did this right after we entered the park and we got front row seats. Since the electrical parade is no longer a show in the US parks, this was the most important ride/show for us. We had fantastic views and it was well worth the cost (about $13 a person).

Besides the DPA, we made the most of the 40th Anniversary Priority Pass which is their free version of the lightning lane. We managed to get 4 rides with the pass throughout our day at the park, before they ran out. And we got there at rope drop and left about 1/2 hr before closing. We got Pooh's Hunny Hunt, Space Mountain, Big Thunder and Buzz Lightyear with the pass. We spent the longest about 30 minutes standing in line at all other rides. But we did not do every ride. We had to pick our favorites, and it was a slow day. I believe that it is pretty much impossible to get on every ride in 1 day, even if you pay for some. We skipped the Baymax ride (the lines were about 1 hr all day long and we didn't really care to ride it), and Beauty and the Beast ride (it was closed for refurbishment).

The best food to eat in Tokyo Disney resort is the popcorn. There are quite a few different flavored popcorn spread out all over the park and this is unique to the resort. You cannot find this at the US parks, so try them all here. I think we tried about 6 kinds of popcorn while we were there. Our favorites were curry, matcha white chocolate, and milk chocolate. The popcorn buckets here are also very different from what you can find in the US, and very cute. Buy some to bring home!

The rest of the food at the resort was a bit disappointing. There isn't much for vegetarians that aren't desserts. They offer a vegetarian stew and a vegetarian curry at a number of locations in the park. That is pretty much it. The Mickey waffles is fantastic though but expect long lines to get them. We pretty much snacked in the parks and ate outside after.

Disney characters come out throughout the day and we came across quite a few. And some you don't see often in the US, like Stitch, Abu, Jafar, Scrooge, and Marie. I don't know if they sign autographs but they definitely take photos with you!

I love this park. I suggest going on a slow day to have a better chance at rides and shows.",Tripadvisor
"…all over the park: in the shops, in between rides, by the parade, by EVERY photograph opportunity spot…they seem to let in an almost dangerous number of people after 5pm with the ‘evening pass’ (which we did, so maybe I shouldn’t complain too much), and it made the experience significantly more hectic and less enjoyable than other Disney parks I have visited in HK, Paris and Florida. Honestly, it was manic. Anyway, the good things that you can expect are similar to other parks with a few differences: our two year old daughter loved the ‘Toon Town’ bits in which she could play and we were very impressed by the ‘Belle’s Village’ and American West areas plus the electric parade too. Still, far too many people admitted to make it that fun I would say.",Tripadvisor
"Tokyo Disneyland has all of the expected perks of Disneyland. Everything is incredibly detailed and well done.

However, it was absolutely insane how many people there were and how long the lines were. I went to the Disneyland in Paris and the lines were nothing like this. It's insane to think that winter is the off season.

Seems like a dangerous amount of people to have in their all at once. I would pay more for my ticket for there to be less people in the park.",Tripadvisor

"Il parco apre dalle 9 alle 21. Da Shinjuku coi mezzi rapidi pubblici ci vuole circa un'ora. Facilmente raggiungibile con due cambi. Arriviamo alle 9 e c'è già il mondo. I biglietti si possono acquistare comodamente online quando si vuole. Parco grande, fatto molto bene. Pochi personaggi Disney a giro come invece pensavo di trovare. Abbiamo trovato solo Wudy a far gli autografi😅. C'è stata la parata e la gente stava lì ore prima ad accamparsi. Le file ai giochi purtroppo troppo lunghe. Minimo 15/20 min fino ad arrivare ai 230 minuti! Anche senza fermarsi mai non ce la si fa a fare tutti i giochi. Varia scelta di cibo ma ovviamente sempre con la fila. Pure per il chiosco dei pop corn.",Tripadvisor

"We booked 3 nights at the exorbitantly priced tokyo disney land resort, not knowing that pm entry tickets are not available to hotel guests and can only be purchased online. A mere year or so ago we were still able to purchase tickets for pm entry at the hotel in person. When you are not resident in the country and do not constantly stare at the ticket website, this detail can easily be missed. Needless to say we had very disappointed kids on the first night cause I sure ain't paying full price to enter the park at 5 pm when there is a cheaper option which is coincidentally not available to hotel guests but only for general purchase online. Needless to say those were sold out by the time we were told.

Disappointing money grab by oriental land.",Tripadvisor
"Do you love Disney but wish the lines were (much) longer? Well, this is your place. For the rest of us who think waiting 3 hours for space mountain is too long, this place is impossible. Lines here are typically 2-5X the time as in Disney Land (LA). Even the little rides had a 45 minute wait; we went on a Monday.
There were almost no kids there and the lines were way too long. Unless you live in Tokyo or hate yourself, don’t go here.",Tripadvisor
"10年振りに来ましたが、プライオリティパスという優先入場の権利をお金で買うことで、待ち時間を他のアトラクションに乗るなどで有効に使えるのはありがたかったです。ちょっと高いけど。
公式のアプリで待ち時間やファーストパスが取れるのは便利だが、入園者数が多いためか、地図の表示ができなかったり非常に時間を要したりしたので、正直使いづらかったですね。回線スピードを十二分に確保したWi-Fiを用意するか、キャリアに増設してもらうかの対策をお願いしたいですね。
10年振りでしたが、新しいアトラクションが増えていて十分楽しめました。",Tripadvisor
This place is truly magical and has some of the most stunning views in all of Japan. This parks customer is absolutely fantastic and the rides are just thrilling. The merchandise available for sale is just excellent. The only complaint I have is that Disney Sea is way too small for the amount of people entering the park leading to ridiculous wait times. That’s why Disney land was my personal favorite and I hope everyone can enjoy the experience of hand shaking one of the many parks mascots.,Tripadvisor
"Beautifully clean, and the staff were friendly, always smiling and efficient. Easy to get to from central Tokyo, but…….

the queues were crazy. Over 3 hours for the big rides. Even trying to use a priority pass or paying extra was futile. We did one sedate train journey around the park, and then walked out at 10am. This was on a cold Tuesday in March, which was supposed to be a quieter day.

40,000 yen down the drain.",Tripadvisor
"夜のパレードのチケットを買って座っていたのですが… スタッフの方が日本人の方には座る場所を厳しく説明しているのですが、外国の方にはスルーしていました。私たちの席は端で座るはずがないのに外国の方が隣に間違えて座った方もいて、私の家族の者が説明して席が解ったのでその席に移動していただきました。スタッフの方はみて見ぬふりをしているように思えました。スタッフの方が外国語がわからないなら、翻訳機などを使ってわかる対応をする努力しても良いと思うのです。
外国の方が柵の所に数人立っていて、あきらかにおかしいのですが…スタッフの方は全く近寄る事もなく、パレードが始まる5分前に私の家族の者が我慢出来ずに(スタッフの方のお仕事だと思うのですが)席があるはずなので、その説明をして移動してもらったのです。そのうちの1人の方は何としてもそこから移動しないでいたら、始まる寸前くらいに、やっとスタッフの方が来て説得したようですが、なかなか動かないのでみていたら先ほどのスタッフの方が、翻訳機を持って来てやっと納得して席に移動したのです。もっと早くやって欲しかった。明らかに外国の方はやりたい放題としか見えないので見ていて、とても気分悪く思います。

"I've been to Anaheim numerous times, the park itself is about par, but the people who work at Tokyo really make this experience worth while. They are so happy! The Beauty and the Beast Ride is incredible, up there with the very best 'character ride' I've been on. I barely speak any Japanese but it is easy to follow along with the narrative as Tokyo Disney have the expressions down pat. If you are up for more of an original Disney taste go here.... If you are up for something a little different try Disney Sea",Tripadvisor

"I'd read about it, I'd researched it, we downloaded the app, we were ready to pay extra for those Premier Access passes once we got in the gates because we're from New Zealand, and we weren't prepared to go all that way and miss out. But nothing prepared us for the crowds. US Disney crowds and queuing are nothing on this crowd. I was so glad we paid extra for Beauty and the Beast - which was a must-see for us, and Splash Mountain. We dida couple more but lucked out on others after that, because we just couldn't get thru on the app. Space Mountain broke at the end of the day, but they gave us free fast past access to a ride at Disney Sea the next day - we thought that was great and appreciated. I'm not sure it would be worth our while again, going to Tokyo Disney just to pay to queue majority of the time. It really does take away the 'buzz, enjoyment and privilege' of being there and we were all adults! You would have to have some really disciplined kids to endure the long-haul queuing for everything, including toilets and basic ice creams and popcorn. And we were there on a Tuesday, in Autumn in off-season! Despite this, it really is a beautiful park which screams joy and happiness.....ohhhh and money!",Tripadvisor

"Of course Disney Tokyo is fun, happy place, but was disappointed as there was no difference with the park from any other themed park. Great imaginative architecture but what really was missing, Disney characters. I was there from 10am to 8pm and saw one character. That was the big bad wolf. Where was Mickey, Mini, Goofy, Donald and gang, Daffy, Pluto.........
That was disappointing. That's why families go, and no magic Kingdom! The staff was great, friendly but dowdy uniforms, lacking imagination cour and a happy feeling. I might as well been in Movieworld not Disney. Prices good, I expected more, parking excellent, but a lack of toilet facilities and dirty toilet blocks compared to Japanese standards. All in all I give it 7 out of 10. I was ok but disappointed",Tripadvisor

"To be clear, this isn’t technically a Disney theme part. It is not owned by Disney; they lease some of the characters from Disney. Because of this, you won’t see the popular characters, and the shops are extremely limited in what you can buy. The food is OK, not Disney quality (no rice crispy treats and the churros are subpar). If you are a vegetarian, you will be limited to sweets as everything else, including salads, has meat in it. I would have given 1 star but some of the rides are pretty impressive. Make sure to ride the Beauty and the Beast ride. IT WAS INCREDIBLE! Get a priority access pass for an extra 2000 yen per person. It is worth it to skip the massive line.",Tripadvisor

"Disney is always on the list for anyone visiting Tokyo, Paris or US.. It was on list of my daughter.

Disneyland Tokyo is a typical Disney experience which is really good and different but Tokyo Disney is missing few things:
- No fast pass/Premier pass available for Disneyland. You need to buy for each ride/event separately and reserve. It's restrictive experience. Eventually you will pay more than double ticket price.
- rides/shows are outdated. Nothing new and you would have seen elsewhere. Nothing great.
- most of the rides/events are SAME with change in scenary reflecting characters. Its Boring.
- No princess dress up
- No princess pic place
- All New princess/characters are missing. Frozen Doenst exist in this Disney 🤷.

It's Disneyland from 20th century, not 21st. Avoid if your kid is not crying for it.",Tripadvisor
"Reviewed this place previously in Jan'23.
We visited again in Apr'23 just AFTER Japanese Spring Break, just BEFORE Golden Week, hence this new review.
With a much lower visitor count compared to our previous trip before Christmas, more experience and a better idea, this is our improved two-day itinerary.

DAY 00.
We were at Tokyo DisneySea for two days. Because it was better to do the harder one first i.e. Tokyo Disneyland's easier.

DAY 1.
0830: Hotel's shuttle bus to Tokyo DisneyLand (TDL).
0840: ""HAPPY 15 ENTRY"" special queue area for hotel guests but...
Note: Tokyo DisneyLand opens later some days and your ""Happy 15 Entry"" head start for hotel guests would be negligible. Check with your hotel/TDR app on the day before visiting!

Area A: ADVENTURELAND
0920: ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" - this ride has short queues everytime I see it. Is it because its entrance doesn't match its indoor arghhh-worthy pirate boat ride?
0950: ""Big Thunder Mountain"" - classic and rather mild roller-coaster ride even for my 5 year-old.

Area B: WORLD BAZAAR
1020: ""Sweetheart Cafe"" - breakfast is the best time for the baked goodies here. Don't be deterred by the long lines here - they clear fast.
1100: ""Toy Station"" etc - best time to shop when others queue for their first few rides.
1200: ""Partners"" - the 1933 copper statue is the de facto photo spot to take pictures, with the palace and garden as backdrop. Professional photographer stationed here. Gotta queue.
1230: ""Omnibus"" - easiest way to get a quick orientation of the park on this open-top double decker bus.

Area C: FANTASYLAND
1300: ""Mickey's PhilharMagic"" - show with 3D glasses and somehow really comfy theatre seats... I accidentally fell asleep both times I was here.
1320: ""Castle Carousel"" - fast-moving queues.
1340: ""It's a Small World"" - fascinating indoor boat ride around the world with lots of Easter eggs for fans to spot.

Area D: WESTERNLAND
1400: ""Camp Woodchuck Kitchen"" - rice burgers with vegetables, teriyaki chicken leg, fried chicken and chips - with both indoor and outdoor seating areas with good prices.
1430: ""Western River Railroad"" train ride and ""Jungle Cruise: Wildlife Expeditions"" boat ride were both awesome.

Area E: TOMORROWLAND
1600: ""The Big Pop"" - the only place selling ALL designs of recent popcorn buckets, and also special flavours not available elsewhere e.g. the seasonal Chicago Cheese Caramel was the BEST!
1610: ""Buzz Lightyear's Astro Blasters"" - shooting game shooting at real objects, kinda like the ""Monsters, Inc"" ride.
1630: ""Star Tours: The Adventures Continue"" - a 4D ride that's like ""Nemo's SeaRider"" in DisneySea.
1700: ""The Happy Ride with Baymax"" has perpetually long queues and really enthusiastic locals who danced non-stop to the upbeat songs. Japan loves Baymax. DPA pass but.. not sure if it's worth it.

Area A: ADVENTURELAND again.
1750: ""China Voyager"" - because we legit needed these bowls of piping hot soup noodles to warm us up before we wait in the cold for the night parade. Many others thought the same, explaining the perpetual long queue for dinners so... do get there early!
1900: ""Tokyo DisneyLand Electrical Parade Dreamlights"" - DPA passes available for a front row seat behind the ""Partners"" copper stature. We waited just outside the cordoned-off area from 6:30pm.
Note: You are recommended to bring picnic mats, heat packs and warm drinks. The cast members will remind everyone in front to sit so that those far behind can watch the show easily too. Thoughtful.

Area F: TOONTOWN
2000: ""Roger Rabbit's Car Toon Spin"", ""Gadget's Go Coaster"" and ""Pooh's Hunny Hunt"" rides had virtually no queues at this time despite having long queues earlier in the day.
Note1: Also cool to take photos of Minnie's, Goofy's and Donald's houses during this time when it's not crowded.
Note2: the water fountain here was surrounded by BLOOMING sakura trees when we were there in April. So pretty! Also awesome to take lots of photos with no people photo-bombing you.

DAY 2.
Area C: FANTASYLAND
0800: Thank God they decided not to open the park late today so our ""HAPPY 15 ENTRY"" (basically a 15-minute head start) was EXTREMELY useful!
0820: ""Enchanted Tale of Beauty and the Beast"" - managed to clear the queue and the ride in 30 minutes. Waiting time averaged at 180 minutes during our last trip! DPA available but snapped up quickly too.

Area E: TOMORROWLAND
0850: ""Space Mountain"" - 40th Anniversary (aka free fast pass) available but gotta reserve them early on your TDR app. First come, first served.
0920: ""Pan Galactic Pizza Port"" - pizza, calzone, green mochi balls for breakfast with no queues. Why not? Long queues for lunch, though.

Area C: FANTASYLAND again.
1010: ""Mickey's Magical Music World"" at Fantasyland Forest Theatre was absolutely worth queuing up for.
Note1: only the first shows of each day allow queuing. All other show timings are via lucky draw on the TDR app.
Note2: Bring caps, shades and maybe even umbrellas. Somehow it's very hot and sunny here during spring.
1030: They let us in early and being the first show, they didn't allocate seats so queuing up early helped us to get good seats!
Note1: Didn't seem impressive on the outside, but this theatre's auditorium-style seating and large-scale stage sets within made it a pleasure to watch. Can't believe this is a free show that's inclusive in TDL's ~usd50 park tickets. Such high quality performances would cost above usd100 in many developed nations. Take pics before because you ain't allowed to take pics during the show.
1050: 20-minute show.

Area G: CRITTER COUNTRY
1130: ""Splash Mountain"" - so.... this ride had been cancelled in other DisneyLands, but not here in TDL!
Note: ""Grandma Sara's Kitchen"" - we ate there once in December and really loved the interior design of the place, built like an underground treehouse of a tree shrew. Consider this place for a meal if you like omurice!

Area D: WESTERNLAND
1215: ""Plaza Pavilion"" - ordered and got our food in under 10 minutes of arriving. Fast.
1245: ""Disney Harmony in Color"" - new parade designed specifically for TDL's 40th anniversary. Aim to get a good seat before 12:30pm if you can.
1400: ""Mark Twain Riverboat"" - one of the few rides that are infant aka stroller-friendly. Love the gorgeous steamship design and the relaxing feeling it gave us when we were on it.
1430: ""Tom Sawyer Island Rafts"" - probably not many visitors were interested, but we really loved exploring this little island. Perpetually empty as not many people cared about visiting it.

Area B: WORLD BAZAAR
1525: ""Disney Christmas Stories"" parade - lasts approximately 20 minutes.
1540: ""Great American Waffle Co."" - we rushed over just before the parade ended. Long story short - we saved 30 minutes of queuing by doing that.
1630: SHOPPING AND PHOTOS TIME. Simply because, it will be so much more crowded in the evenings just before closing time. Get in some photos of their iconic Christmas trees if you visit in Dec.

Area E: TOMORROWLAND again.
1800: ""Tomorrowland Terrace"" - fast food so it's super fast... come here if you are tired of queuing anymore like us.
NOTE: Oooooo nobody mentioned this but, we noticed the ""TDL Electrical Parade"" would definitely pass by the full-glass windows of the tippy end of Tomorrowland Terrace!!!
So if you don't wanna sit outside in the cold to wait for the parade to start, it might just be possible to just sit at those window counter seats and watch the parade from inside! Limited seats, though.
1900: ""Tokyo DisneyLand Electrical Parade"" - watch it again, if you wanna or... just take any rides you've missed. All rides have short queues at this time.

FINAL TIP:
Something useful they added only recently - ""Disney Mobile Order"" - it really helps since you can order in advance via the TDR app and minimize queue times.
During our visits, we noticed some visitors took a really long time to order, especially with the language barriers.
This is proof that TDR constantly reviews and fine-tunes their six-sigma processes toward perfection. Cool.
Only available at some eateries so you might wanna check out each store on the app in advance.

"Excelente parque, fácil de llegar, fácil de entrar, la aplicación de las atracciones te ayuda mucho a organizar tu día, la comida dentro del parque es excelente, mucho mejor de lo que esperábamos. El restaurante de la Reyna de corazones esta excelente!!",Tripadvisor
"Works out at over $30 -$40 per ride each for the few you can fit in after waits of 1-3 hours per ride. Enormous queues for everything including restaurants, drinks/snacks, bathroom. One great thing though, you can book priority on at least one ride while you're there,depending on how long you stay. You can only do this whilst in the park.",Tripadvisor
"I was pleasantly surprised by Tokyo Disneyland – it truly lived up to all the hype. The park's size caught me off guard, leading to a lot of walking, but it's all part of the experience. Given the immense popularity, arriving early is key to enjoying the rides without exceptionally long wait times; you might find yourself waiting for up to 90 minutes for some attractions. So, bring your patience with you, remember you're on vacation, and immerse yourself in the magic of the place. I'll be returning in a few days – that's how much I enjoyed it!",Tripadvisor
"Dieses Disneyland ist wunderschön eingebettet in Grün und angelegt im typischen Disneystyle. Die Angestellten sind ausgesprochen lieb und freundlich. In den Restaurants bekommt man mit guter Planung auf jeden Fall einen Platz. Wir kennen bis auf 1 Disneyland alle weltweit und haben uns im Disneyland Tokyo sehr wohl gefühlt.
Erreichbar ist es bequem per Bahn.",Tripadvisor
"I was unable to purchase park passes using a Canadian debit or credit card; neither through the website or the app. Had to use a 3rd party seller and Klook worked well. Was able to then print the passes and put them into the Disney app. I'd ended up purchasing one additional day at the end of my trip and because I only had my phone and couldn't print or use another device, I was unable to put that ticket in the Disney app so didn't have access to premium access purchases in the Disney app. I was still able to book a dining reservation through.
I tried to book a dining reservation the 30 days in advance as the app allows, but all the restaurants book up very quickly. Was able to get a reservation at Crystal Palace Restaurant for mid-afternoon; only option. Was a good choice as it's a buffet with a variety of food.
Get there early! The park actually opened the gates 30 mins before posted opening time on both days I attended. The smaller rides didn't have long wait times, 20-30 mins, but the big rides like Haunted Mansion were consistently 100 minutes. Cost of entry tickets was less than US parks which allows some room to purchase Premium Access passes. I was there off seasons, during the week, and the park was still very packed and busy.
I found the rides superior to those in the US. The rides seem to run better and smoother; there is more colour and more characters. Truly magical, amazing rides. It's a Small World had so so many more characters and colours; it's phenomenal!. Beauty and the Beast was like being in a dream! Souvenirs are quite pricey. Try some different flavours of popcorn.",Tripadvisor
"This park wasn’t originally on the list as we thought it would just be another Magic Kingdom and yeah, it is but that exactly why I’m glad we went in the end.

This park has some great rides and some which caught me off guard a little. The classics such as Big Thunder Mountain; Star Tours; It’s a Small World and Haunted Mansion are all here and are their usual fun and enjoyable selves.

The addition of Beauty and the Beast and other rides which you don’t find at other Disney parks just help set this version of Magic Kingdom apart. Space
Mountain was a little gem too. It was fast and frenetic and had the perfect amount of out of control feeling with some nice little pops of airtime. Yes, I know it’s being replaced with a new version in 2027 but I really enjoyed this one.

Queues were excessive for a weekday and the priority pass for the rides did end of being used up pretty quickly but you can’t help get swept up in the Disney-ness of it all.",Tripadvisor
"We went and really enjoyed this Disneyland. It isn't significantly different from the one in Anaheim, except it is in Japan and they speak Japanese of course. But the hosts were so proud of their jobs and it shows. They always had a smile, always were waving with a smile. That little touch just makes this place better. We had a young infant with us, and she is the boss you know, so we had to take a lot of time out to care for her needs.

The food is very different here, and if you like American food, you may have a difficult time eating here. All of the food places were very busy. But the food is inexpensive for Americans because of the favorable exchange rate, as is the park cheaper by almost half.

The weather was very pleasant when we went, which made it more enjoyable. I would advise any American that in Japan it is considered rude to walk and eat at the same time. This includes carrying a bottle of water or beverage. So buy your food or beverage, have a seat, and enjoy it before moving on.

I found the crowd to be entertaining as it was approaching Halloween and many of the young ladies were dressed up as Disney Princesses. I don't know if that is a year around thing, or just a Holloween thing, but that was enjoyable. I suspect they always do it.",Tripadvisor
"Ich war an einem Wochentag gegen 9 Uhr am Eingang und es war bereits die Hölle los.
Der Taxifahrer lachte nur und meinte „it‘s not even holidays“.

Ich hatte zum Glück mein Ticket am Vortag online gekauft. Ich bin mir nicht einmal sicher, ob man vor Ort überhaupt noch ein Ticket hätte kaufen können.
Nach knapp 45 min Wartezeit war ich endlich im Park.

Völlig unverkleidet als Disneycharakter und ohne Disney-Accessoires, wie z.B. Mickey Mouse Ohren etc., fühlt man sich tatsächlich etwas fehl am Platz ;)

Es war aber dennoch ein sehr vergnügter Ausflug.
Man muss sich allerdings auf lange Wartezeiten einstellen.",Tripadvisor
"Between us this was our 6th visit to a Disneyland park around the world. We visited as we’d heard shops etc might be closed on Mondays otherwise we hadn’t thought to go. From the word go, it was an experience of non-stop queuing, some rides being over at least an hour’s wait and one of them over 3 hours just before we left. The crowds were, to be honest, unbearable. We were moved on by staff twice from resting our poor beleaguered bodies on walls and as for trying to cross the road prior to the parade, one couldn’t. There were hoards of people, 4 or 5 deep, sitting on blankets ensconced with refreshments waiting for hours for the parade. We noticed when they’d relinquished their precious space that there were numbers on the floor obviously for people to cling to. While the below par parade was going on we took total advantage and managed to get inside the tower as there were hardly any people in there, bliss. We actually managed 4 hours but that was probably because of queuing for the few rides we actually went on. If you enjoy a permanent obstacle course avoiding people and I mean bodily avoiding them as they seem to have no concept of anyone in front of them and queuing for hours this is the place for you!",Tripadvisor
"今年6月にTDSを訪れた時は、入園者数も増えコロナ禍前の賑わいが戻っていました。それでもアトラクション・レストラン・ショップでの待ち時間は以前の様な混雑は影を潜め、日曜日にもかかわらずストレス無く楽しめました。高値の日曜日を避けた人が、客離れを起こさずに平日にシフトしていれば良いのですが・・・？？？
確かめるべく10月の月曜日にTDLを訪れてみました。ハロウィーンイベント開催中のTDLと梅雨入り後のTDSを単純比較はできませんが、今回は平日にもかかわらず入園者の行列がメインエントランスの前に溢れており、2021年春に導入されたダイナミックプライシングにより、休日と平日の需要が平準化されたような気がします！！
需要が高いタイミングで価格を上げ、高くても買いたい層を最大限取り込む一方で、需要が低いタイミングでは価格を下げ、この価格なら買おうという購買意欲を刺激して、売り逃しを最小限にできます。これにより価格が高い時から安い時に振り向けられ、需要が平準化する効果があり、教科書通りの結果が出ているような印象でした。
AI等の活用が進み顧客データや販売データに加え、天候やアトラクションの人気といったこれまで活用することが難しかった様々なデータを素早く反映させることが可能になり、需要予測やタイムリーな価格設定が格段に容易になったそうです。
TDLと米国ディズニーワールド（マジックキングダム）の入園料から計算した購買力平価を考慮すると、最近の150円を超える円安で内外価格差が更に拡大しています。国内だけではなくインバウンドを前提とした需要の平準化が望まれますが、米国並みに価格変動幅を拡大すると、「夢の国」は「安い国ニッポン」の国民には行けない遠い国になってしまうかもしれません。入園者の満足度を維持しながら利益を最大化するには、価格は非常に重要な経営判断であり、試行錯誤は想像に難しくありません。キャストの質が低下したとの感想も目立ちますが、人件費はコストではなく人への投資と考え、適正な利益追求を期待したいです。",Tripadvisor
"Ich war bisher in Orlando und Paris im DL, diese beiden würde ich vorziehen. Ich vermisse die Größe von Orlando und die Rollercoaster aus Paris. Tokyo ist mir zu klein und dafür viel zu voll. Dass es eins der ältesten ist merkt man an manchen Details, sonst bekommt man die typische Disney-Kost. Positiv erwähnen muss man auf jeden Fall, dass hier alles etwas besser organisiert scheint, auch wenn die Sicherheitskontrolle vor dem Eingang erstmal nicht so wirkt.",Tripadvisor
"We really enjoyed the time we had here, we had a full day and also an evening pass for Disneyland.
We really enjoyed the parades, I personally haven’t seen a Main Street Electrical parade since the year 2000 at a family visit to Disneyland Paris. It brought back happy memories!
We were really impressed with the daytime parades, a lot better than the ones we are used to at Disneyland Paris, and that people were able to cross at certain times.
There were fireworks near the end of the park which can be viewed anywhere in the park, which we really enjoyed.
The Cast Members are very friendly and nice, like all hospitality workers in Japan they were very attentive and took pride in their job.
We used the Premier Access and 40th Anniversary Pass for a couple of the rides, as we stayed in a Disney hotel we made use of our early 15 tickets and managed to get into the queue for the Haunted Mansion before the park opening.
My partner was slightly disappointed that we were unable to prebook a restaurant in advance, but the counter service restaurants are amazing quality and we didn’t really miss out on good food in the park.
The main annoyance we had was when people were sat in their spots for hours before the parade. In some areas, they were near enough blocked off by these people sat down and you had to jump between/over them to get to places. During the parades this was amazing, everyone sat down as you can see everything but we found those sat for 5 hours before hand blocking areas to be a bit extreme.",Tripadvisor
"Disney siempre será Disney. Me encanta el parque y me gustó mucho que se puede entrar al castillo. Algunas atracciones estaban cerradas como la de Buzz Lightyear y la de It's a Small world. Los shows están en japonés y no hay traducciones. El juego de Stitch es 100% japonés, por lo que no ente demás nada. Creo que faltó un poco de la magia de Disney de ver con más frecuencia a los personajes por ahí.

Quedamos muy molestos porque al final cancelaron el show de fuegos artificiales diciendo que era por condiciones climatológicas... y el cielo estaba 100% despejado, no había lluvia, ni bruma ni nada que impidiera un buen show. Nos fuimos muy decepcionados y enojados por eso. Y la excusa del clima nos sonó más a una mentira. Veamos la última foto que subo donde el cielo está completamente despejado.",Tripadvisor

"Since I was going to Japan, figured I visit their parks. Yes lines everywhere like other parks. Their priority pass system is what the fastpass system in the states used to be. You only have to pay for a pass for certain rides and shows. All the others are free, and you can make your picks once your tickets are scanned in. It is a nice spread out park, unlike Anaheim DL, but it can feel like a maze. One thing I loved, no huge stroller parking areas. There were people with no strollers. The only ones that used them like battering rams were foreigners. There were only a few rides we did not do, and Big Thunder was closed when we went. Which was disappointing as I would have liked to compare that one. Make sure to have plenty of 100 yen coins on you. If you like to do the pressed pennies in the state parks. They have pressed medallions at Tokyo.",Tripadvisor

"I wish I could give a zero just for that entry request. It is total BS! Let me explain.

In the app, you can request an entry for any of the 3 shows. This however doesn't garentee you an entry. It is based on a LOTTERY system! That's right! So even if you pay the price of admission and even if you only get to see this park once because you are from oversees? Too bad, you can go to hell. I tried with all 3 shows and didn't get entry to any one of them! There isn't even a way to wait in a line for these.

But wait, it gets so much worse.

This system is so flawed that even if you are a group, it will have no problem letting some members through and not others! So families wanting to see this can be broken up! WHY??

And to top it all off, you can only make 1 request for each show the day you are in the park. So your dissapointment will only be realized when you actually try for a ticket and it doesn't matter if there is room. The lottery system cares for no one.

This is such an insult to tourists, families, children, groups and basically ANYONE who enters this park. Just for that, it deserves a 1/5!",Tripadvisor

"Get vacation package, just get it. It’s worth it.
2 days vacation package should be perfect, we had it 3, it was too much.
For a vacation package you can access Disney sea, and fantasy springs that just open in June 2024. The most awesome was that with the package, we don’t need to line up in the queue at all, we did all them 4 within 1 hour we were there at 13:00, so we actually had all day to do whole Disney sea.

The queue for frozen was 85 mins, and walked straight in queue inside for let’s say 10 min max.",Tripadvisor
"So many photo opportunities :)
The app helped alot with planning our next ride throughout the day. I'd definitely go again but want to try Disney Sea",Tripadvisor
"Upon entering the park, bypassing bon voyage store. If you’re wanting to take pictures with a character, you have to do it upon entry. Not guaranteed either and you only get one try a day.

Shopping in stores, there is one inside the castle, very pricey (as Disney usually is)

You’re limited on special limited edition items like pins. They scan your passport (for park) to make sure you only get one.

It’s not as fun as DiseneySea. Park carries cke products, water and mango flavored drinks with other combinations.

I like the other park vs this one. Absolutely didn’t like long lines for character greeting and the one try only. Didn’t ride rides due to medical condition.

This park does have a splash area like Disney World has. Works great for hot summer weather.",Tripadvisor

"Despite the torrential rain, Tokyo Disneyland was a fun family day out during our trip to Japan. It's very clean, the cast members are polite and the wait times for the rides was quite quick considering it was busy. The food choices were limited and the queue's long but typical theme park experience. Our only gripe is that the Beauty and the Beast ride was closed mid-afternoon for maintenance and the cast members were rude and seemed to be ill-informed as to if/when the ride would be re-opened. As such, we missed the best ride in the park which was very disappointing. The app is easy to use for the ticket entry but not so easy to use to navigate your way around the park. Overall, a great day though.",Tripadvisor
We purchased on like entry tickets and then upgraded to VIP for around US$10 each on the Disney resort app once we entered the park. This allowed us to book a time for two rides and meant we didn’t have to queue for them. Worked out great as you have an hour window to use your upgrades. Really well organised and friendly staff. Our kids (13 and 17) loved it. We had small crowds and no waiting time to enter the park.,Tripadvisor
"Tokyo Disney land was such an incredible visit❤️. I loved the way they introduced us and how they made it feel so much fun. My favourite part was when we watched the 4D show. I couldn’t understand what they’re saying in Japanese. That’s why it was a bit hard to enjoy, but I still enjoyed the whole show and enjoyed the trip. I didn’t like how there were really really long queues that we have to wait for really long. they also had a lot of popcorn shops and the popcorn tasted delicious. I also bought many popcorn boxes . When we went it
was very, very sunny and hot. when we entered, there was a very long line, but very quickly we entered the gate. I also enjoyed many rides. when we entered the gate, we had to plan where we were going on the phone📱.I had plenty of fun and enjoyed the entire fun trip.

"It truly is the most magical and happiest place on Earth! I visited Tokyo Disneyland with my husband and our two teenagers. We all had the most wonderful day. As we were staying at a Disney Resort Hotel, I was able to pre-order the tickets online from my own country through the Hotel. On the morning of our visit, I simply had to pick them up and pay for them from the Hotel Disney Tickets desk. We were also able to book express access to many of the rides through the Disney app, which saved us hours of standing in line for rides. And, most of the express access was free! Every staff member was smiling and happy, which added to the happy atmosphere and the enjoyment of our day. The parade at 8pm was fabulous! So many lights and Disney characters. We were all amazed at the use of technology on the rides. Some of it was mind-blowing! For example, the Beauty and the Beast experience was incredible!",Tripadvisor

东京迪士尼离东京市区不远，涩谷打车过来半小时左右，也有地铁可以直接到，但是要转乘好几次。东京的交通非常复杂。总体体验感很不错，我们去的是一个周五，人不算多。基本上排队都在半小时之内。可以在园内固定时间点抢快速通。园内的项目比较适合8岁以下孩子和女孩子。刺激度不如娱乐性。里面吃的东西要比上海迪士尼便宜不少。爆米花只要10几块钱人民币。,Tripadvisor
"It's the Disney Land experience you expect and love. The newest ride, Beauty and the Beast was the most spectacular, it had incredibly advanced animatronics and did a good job of condensing the story into a small magic experience. Pooh’s Hunny Hunt ride and Monsters, Inc are also unique and well crafted attractions. Otherwise it's very similar to any other Disney Land with the old favourites all being as good as ever.",Tripadvisor

"We visited in May 2023 during Golden week. We are avid Disney goers having visited California and Florida a combined 8 times. We knew Golden week was possibly the worst time to go and were prepared for that. The park was not as busy as i thought it would be. The main attractions( Slash Mountain, Mine Train, Baymax, Beauty and the Beast) were always busy (over 2 hour waits) which was expected. The crowds in the park were more than acceptable and i never felt crowded like California or Florida. However, eating Gluten Free was a completely different story to the point of being a nightmare. I am a diagnosed Celiac. We researched at home before hand and found the offer ""Low allergen meal"" which means its free from the top 5 allergies. We reserved and the Golden Horseshoe the first night and the only option was a kids meal. Less than impressed. The only other options is a ""vegetable Curry or Vegetable Stew both with rice"" that is served at counter restaurants. This severely limited what i could eat. WE did bring a pile of snacks and food from the grocery store at Ikspari (on the first floor) and the staff/security didn't seem to care at bag check. If you are a GF person, please check the menus and plan ahead. I am sure i lost some weight on this trip.",Tripadvisor
"C’était MAGIQUE ! Le parc est très bien entretenu, les nouveautés sont top et la nourriture est vraiment abordable comparé à certains de ces cousins (européens comme américains), nous nous sommes régalés et nous en avons pris pleins les yeux ! Par contre, je vous engage à venir 1h avant l’ouverture officielle car les japonais non pas peur d’attendre et pour les parades non plus !",Tripadvisor

"We visited on a weekday & had a pretty good day.
We went on a few rides & the lines weren’t too bad, we never waited more than 20 minutes.
It’s very clean, including the toilets.
The worst thing is the incredibly long lines to get any sort of food or drink.They seriously need more food outlets.
We got a small glimpse of Mickey Mouse & other characters.",Tripadvisor

"Biasanya orang akan menghabiskan waktu seharian di Disneyland (10 am - 9 pm). Jadi bagi muslim menemukan tempat shalat adalah hal yg sangat penting, karena harus menjalankan shalat dzuhur dan ashar (bisa juga di jama' pada salah satu waktu), adapun maghrib dapat di jama' pada waktu isya.
Disneyland menyediakan tempat shalat, caranya: minta kepada staff di Main Street House, kemudian staff akan menyiapkan tempat shalatnya (lengkap dengan sajadahnya).
Cuman untuk wudhu kita harus nyari toilet yang agak kosong, karena fasilitas khusus untuk wudhu saat itu belum tersedia. Toilet yg paling dekat dan memungkinkan untuk wudhu ada di area tomorrowland.
Oh iya, pastikan wudhu dulu sebelum minta staff menyiapkan tempat shalat, biar nggak 2 kali minta...",Tripadvisor

"We went there on a Wednesday it was still too crowded filled with students and Japanese youth. Could not find any shows in English language. I know we’re in Japan but being a tourist attraction they should have considered this. We barely saw characters going around the park for meet and greet . It was difficult to communicate with the staff and sometimes they would just shoo you away if they couldn’t understand you. You would see a lot of families with their poor kids crying because of the long lines and unacceptable number of people around the park. I went to Disney world a couple of times, lots of people, long lines as well but not to the point that you couldn’t find anywhere or any rides to go to. Tokyo Disneyland was a crowded mess. Also, the main castle was on renovation. Not too much rides for the amount people that they let in. It’s just not meant for foreigners especially with kids because you will just end up frustrated. The light show in the end was spectacular, it was the only nice thing that ever happened while we were there.",Tripadvisor

かつては北富士演習場での山菜採り、五合目近辺での松茸狩り（コケモモ狩りになってしまうのですが）、吉田うどん、など山麓各所を訪れたものです。現在では出張時の往復に運が良ければ目にする存在になってしまいました。10月中旬、富士市東方の車窓です。,Tripadvisor

"決して登っていて楽しい山ではありません。雲海と溶岩の殺風景が続き、雲が切れれば、眼下に麓の街が見える程度です。飛騨や木曽の山々や低山ハイキングなどであれば、様々な植物や連峰がそびえる絶景などを楽しめます。

今まで何度か登山の経験があり、次に富士山を選ぶなら良いと思います。登山経験がないならば勧められません。他の3000メートル前後の山と比べても、かなりつらいです。つまらない思い出になってしまうかもしれません。

といっても、登る人の多くは、それらを百も承知で行くと思います。富士山に登った記念や経験がほしいという話。頂上の噴火口跡は圧巻です。これは見る価値があるでしょう。

私は朝一番のバスで登り、最終バスで帰るという行程を選びました。相当に体力に自信のある人でないと勧められません。理由は高所に体が慣れないため、登り始めから息がつらくなってしまうからです。
そうして思った以上に登りで時間がかかってしまうと、帰りのバスの時間も気になってしまいます。下りで時間短縮を図りたくなるために、急いでしまって転倒の危険なども。
5合目で一泊し、早朝から上り始めれば、時間も体力的にも余裕を持って登ることができるでしょう。",Tripadvisor

"日本迪士尼園內很乾淨，氛圍很好，排隊秩序非常好，建議可以提早1-2小時到排隊，不然人潮實在是很多，光進入前就得花上20分鐘以上～

剛好去的時候是本月壽星，可以和園內的任何一位服務人員詢問領取壽星happy birthday貼紙！可在園內走動時秀出來，這樣會有很多服務人員會說祝你生日快樂～

"12月3日、取れなくて取れなくてやっと取れたチケットでランドに行ってきました。その日はなぜかシーは9時までなのにランドだけ6時半で閉園のせいか料金は通常より800円ぐらい？安かったんです。開園は9時からでしたが30分前に開けてくれ大喜びで入園。コロナのせいか楽しみにしていた大きなツリーもなし、それどころかパーク内の装飾も殆どクリスマスらしさが感じられず、寂しい想いをしました。人混みを避けるために、ということでしょうが、遊びにきた客の殆どが数少ないイルミネーションのところで写真を撮るのに集中し、大混雑していました。お店も所々中身がもぬけの殻になっており閉店したのか？夢の国ならせめて目隠しぐらいして欲しかったです。
6時半に閉園は分かっていたので仕方がないとしても、トイレを利用しようとしたら、出口付近のトイレをご利用くださいと何箇所も断られる始末。聞けばこの後JTBの抽選で当たった人達のご招待が夜間にあるとの事。私たちはエレクトリカルパレードは観れたものの花火は観られなかったのにJTBの人たちは観られたそうです。抽選で当たった人たちは確かにラッキーだけど私たちだって頑張ってチケットを取ってお金を払って来ているのですから、それ以上に大切にして欲しいと思いました。帰りにお土産すら閉鎖されて買えなかったのでボンボヤージュに辿り着くまでも大混雑の中。やっと入ったお店にはお菓子もその他の食品もありませんでした。もっとアナウンスをしても良いのではないでしょうか。頑張ってて感じの良いキャストも多いですが、嫌な感じだなと思うキャストも確かにいるので、悲しいですが、質が下がったのは本当だったんだと思いました。",Tripadvisor
"お土産のお菓子が買えない＋欲しいお土産も在庫切れ。

"開業の年から約39年通ってます。
ここ数年感じていた事が幾つかありますが、もはや堪忍袋の緒が切れました。

▪️キャストの質が著しく低下してます。
（人によって言うことがバラバラで誤案内が多い、態度が酷い、色々と振る舞いが雑で気が利かない）

▪️清掃がかなり杜撰になったと感じます。
（清掃が雑なうえに、ゲストが食事してる横で清掃したり、ほうきや雑巾を持ってぶつかってこないで欲しい）

▪️マナーが悪い人が増えた分、きちんと注意・啓発をして頂きたい。
（特に現在は、コロナ禍の収束が見えないなかマスクしない、間隔を開けない人を全く注意しない）

▪️コロナ禍前よりマシですが人詰め込みすぎです。
そんなに利益を優先したいなら、チケット代を倍程度にし、人数を制限した上で、きちんとしたサービスを提供して欲しいです。

▪️頑なにグッズ等の転売対策をされませんが、そこまで転売ヤーを儲けさせたい理由をなんでしょうか。

▪️スマホアプリやサイトがお粗末なのは何の戦略でしょうか。
悪意すら感じます。
UIを改善し軽快に動く様にしてほしいです。

▪️スマートデバイスに寄りすぎてる気がします。
高齢な方などスマホを使いこなせない人間は、もはや客では無いという事でしょうか。

きっとオリエンタルランドの方は見てないでしょうが傲慢さが垣間見れ残念です。

"子供のころ、東京ディズニーランドへは、何度も来ていて年間パスポートも持っており、何度も来ても楽しくて飽きなかったが、ここ近年、オリエンタルランドのパークの運営に疑問感じながらも来てました…
まずパークの運営に関しては、近年はコスト削減なのかキャストの質やショーとパレードの内容が落ちたこと、レストランでは、テーブルサービスの和食のお店で出された茶わん蒸しは、容器に直接具材が入っておらず、スーパーで売っているいうなプラ容器に具材が入っているものを茶碗にはめ込んで提供されていたのには、非常に残念でした…
パークイベントでスーベニアカップにプラ容器にケーキが入ったものをはめ込むのと同じです。
高いお店で板前さんがいるはずなのに他のパークにあるカウンター方式並みにすでに工場調理している冷蔵ものをレンジで温めたものを茶碗にプラ容器のまま、はめ込んで提供するのは、明らかにぼったくりだと感じます。
ミシュランに選らばれたレストランで働かれている方や他の飲食関係の方からすると批判される内容です。

過去には、一部キャストにパレードを鑑賞中に少し線からつま先が、はみ出た時やレストランで並んでいる時に柱を避けようと動いたら、すごい剣幕で注意してきたり、パークの事を熟知してない、パレードの先頭や最後尾でコントロールキャストとともに歩いている社員が、無愛想で残念…

次にショーやを鑑賞するやキャラクターと写真を撮る際にコロナ禍前は、抽選方式制度があり、現在はエントリーで継続されていますが、抽選に外れたり、エントリーで席が用意ができないと鑑賞できないという始末。
首都圏近郊の方なら、近いのでいつでも来れますが、遠方だと交通費もかかり、いつでも来れないのでショーが見れないと非常に残念な気持ちになります。
中には、バケーションパッケージで鑑賞できますが、こちらは高くそう簡単に払えるものではありませんし、代金と内容が釣り合っておらず、ぼったくりに近いです。

東京ディズニーランド25周年から5周年周期のイベントでは、東京ディズニーランド○周年ではなく、何故か東京ディズニーリゾート○周年と東京ディズニーシーとともにイベントを開催した際は、なぜ東京ディズニーシーは、2～3年置きにお祝いするのに東京ディズニーランドになるとランドだけでお祝いしないのか？、東京ディズニーシー周年イベントになると9月4日からではなく東京ディズニーランド開園日の4月15日にして正直、変だし複雑です。

あとは、最近は、欲しいグッズがあってもすぐ品切れなったり、メルカリやアマゾンなどのネットショップなど転売目的で購入する非常識な輩もおり、購入できず嫌気がさしました。

あとは、パークに来園する方で非常識な方が多く、パークに向かうリムジンバスなど交通機関内やパークを歩いているると差別的な発言をする恥ずかしい馬鹿も多くてパークに来る人は、民意が低すぎてそういう人の集まってこないのかと行く気も失せました。

これで今やパークチケット代9,000円以上と高く、お金を払ってまで行く価値がないのかと感じるようになり、大好きだった東京ディズニーリゾートへ行く価値はないかなと感じて今後は行かないことにしました。

以上を踏まえて最近のオリエンタルランドには、非常に残念です…",Tripadvisor
"エレクトリカルパレードが11月から始まり、とても良かったです。
が、スタンバイパスが１つしか取れませんでした。
スタンバイパスのアトラクションは基本１つしか乗れないと思っていた方がいいかもです。

数年ぶりに子連れで行きました。行く価値なし、の一言です。入園料だけ馬鹿高くなっていくのに、どのアトラクションも80-100分待ちは当たり前、これだけの入園料を取るのにファストパスは有料、レストランも予約できない、予約なしで入れるレストランも、あの値段でこれ、な散々なクオリティ。ショーもエントリーできない。ホテルをとってシーとランドを2日間で行きましたが、とにかく何でもかんでも並ばされ、アトラクションも大して乗れず、マズい食事にぼったくられ、何の満足感もなく疲れ果ててぐったり帰りました。どう考えても詰め込みすぎです。せめて30分程度の待ち時間でアトラクションに乗れるよう等改善すべきでしょう。数年前までは行く度そこそこの満足感があったと記憶しているのですが。今後もこのまま劣化していくのでしょうか。金集めだけのネズミの国。大事な時間とお金の無駄です。,Tripadvisor
Love Tokyo Disneyland! We went on a rainy Tuesday mid November. Crowds were not too bad however we did purchase the fast pass for the Beauty and the Beast ride for 2000¥ per person. This was the best ride in the park. Cast members were friendly and welcoming. Tasty snacks and food all around. Shopping was fun too. Easy access from Tokyo Station by train..20 minutes to Maihama.,Tripadvisor
"毎年行っていましたが、コロナ中は自粛していたので明けで久しぶりにクリスマスにシーへ行きました。金額は日曜日で9400円ですが、まぁ物価上昇やコロナの影響もあると考え納得。しかし、食事をとりたくて並べばスタッフが今まで経験したことないほど、モタモタとされており会計も笑顔なく真顔で対応していたのには驚きました。さらに、パレードは誘導がきちんと案内しないのでマナーの悪い人だけ誘導を無視してパレード鑑賞ができる状態。そして極め付けは、ファストパスがアプリ化したもの（名前を忘れました）がなくなり、複数のアトラクションだけ2000円を出せば並ばないでいいとサービスに切り替わってました。１万円近い入場料と交通費を使い３時間待ちのアトラクションを並ぶのは時間と体力的に効率が悪いと考え2千円でソアリンの優先権を買いましたが、もう楽しくなかったです。毎年行ってましたが、初めてディズニーでストレスを感じてお金の無駄だと感じました。

"at Tokyo Disneyland There were a lot of people when I visited because Japanese people like Disneyland. I went with my family I got to play 3 rides. Each ride is very crowded, both children and adults. There are many rides that I haven't played because there are so many people. The 1st ride that I went on was monster, inc. It was a cute ride suitable for children. The second ride that I played was Toy Story. This ride was not crowded and was for children. The last ride I took was star wars, it was my favorite ride because it was a 4D ride where we got to sit on a spaceship. I have finished playing, I have come to eat ramen. until 6:00 p.m. Disneylan has many pallets. There are many things that come to march. I like it very much, both beautiful and cute, and I went home. The weather was very cold today.",Tripadvisor
"This Disneyland is just ok- nothing special. Huge crowds detract from the day not only for rides but ques for restaurants and street carts (an hours wait for popcorn 😳).
We spent a full day and did hardly any of the big rides due to a 2-3+ wait time (we were there on a Tuesday).
We ended up paying to get priority access to Beauty & the Beast- glad we did- the ride was amazing and one of the most memorable of all Disneyland’s I’ve been too.
Glad I went but would not return again.
Highly recommend paying for any fast passes you can/priority access to get more out of your day.",Tripadvisor

"Il Parco è bellissimo, curato nei minimi dettagli, pulitissimo e ordinato. Ci sono tanti negozi e luoghi in cui mangiare qualcosa. Le code sono lunghe come in ogni altro parco divertimenti, infatti non capisco le recensioni negative su questo punto. Le code ci sono sempre, è la nota negativa, ma ci si sta un giorno minimo dentro proprio perché cosi ci si organizza e si fa tutto con calma. I giochi che ho fatto sono adatti sia ai bambini che agli adulti perché comunque la magia di Disneyland non ha età e se venite qui è anche per questo motivo. Abbiamo passato una giornata favolosa, ci siamo divertiti tanto.. era come stare dentro una favola, consigliatissimo e spero di tornare un giorno!",Tripadvisor
"It’s of course very baby-friendly, there are 2 baby centres. One is near the entrance at Tomorrowland and one is suitably in Toontown. The Toontown one closes at 7pm so just take note of that. Each baby centre has individual nursing rooms (with curtains), diaper changing station and feeding stations with high chairs for the babies and regular chairs for the parents.

The lines for the restaurants were terrible, literally could not get a seat at 11am and 5pm. In order to do that, you’d have to start going to the food places at 10am and 4pm to be really comfortable. Good thing is the park closes at 9pm so there’s still lots of playtime after.

Everyone there (mainly the locals) are wearing their fancy Disney hats/hair bands/headgear and carrying their popcorn buckets around, so don’t be afraid to do so as well. You won’t seem out of place at all, even on the monorail. Be sure to buy the popcorn buckets early on in your trip so you can carry it around. A tip if you don’t want to have to wash it would be to request for a voucher in which they will actually give you 2 regular boxes of popcorn at any other popcorn wagon in Disneyland or DisneySea! That way, you can choose other flavours too.

Downloading the app is a must to monitor wait times and also submit your entries for entry request and Disney premier access. I would say that the Disney premier access, though seemingly expensive, was a life and time saver as it enabled us to literally breeze through the crowd right to the pre-show for beauty and the beast. Instead of waiting in line for 3 hours. Managed to get 1 entry request only over 2 days so I think it’s quite common not to get anything at all, don’t be too disappointed. A pity about the FastPass system being replaced.

Of course, don’t forget your parade timings! It’s common to place a mat and sit down to watch the parade (you could start getting ready about 30 minutes before the showtime).",Tripadvisor

今年の３月に１人ディズニーを決行してから約８ヶ月、入場制限が緩和されつつある11月中旬の金曜日に家族と再訪しました。チケットが大量に再販されている中でしたが、この日は完売。入園待ちで並んでいる時にも当日チケットの販売はない旨のアナウンスが繰り返されていました。最近は混雑対策で入園開始が早まる傾向にあり、9時前にはパーク内に入ることができました。アトラクションは時間にならないと動かないので、まずはアトラクションのスタンバイパス取得とショーのエントリーを済ませ、歩いてパークの奥まで行っておくと効率的です。今回は多くの人で賑わっているもののコロナ前ほどのストレスはありません。また、若者のグループが少なくマウンテン系は終日10分待ち程度。逆にウエスタンリバー鉄道が閉園間際まで30分待ちでした。昼のパレードは比較的空いている一方、エレクトリカルパレードは再開されたばかりとあって大人気。30分前くらいに行けば充分だろうと思っていたら、かなり後ろの方での鑑賞となってしまいました。最後のアトラクションに乗り終わると既に閉園時間を少し過ぎていましたが、ワールドバザールのお菓子系のお店は大混雑で入店待ちの行列がカリブの海賊の入口横で折り返すほど。5000人制限中だった前回は快適な一方で寂しくもあったので、今回、戻りつつある活気を感じて嬉しく思いました。客層も良く適度に賑わう今のようなパークが続いてほしいと願うのは私の勝手ですね。,Tripadvisor
"コロナ対策で来場者を、制限しておりとても空いていました。列もソーシャルディスタンスを保つため、立ちっぱなしで待つのではなく間隔を開けゆっくり進むので疲労も少ないです。

All the buidlings, walkways, lands are just larger, more updated. It's a fantastic park, and easy access from DisneySea.",Tripadvisor
通常は雨の日しか行わない夜のパレードが行われていました。すごく綺麗でよかったです。お昼のパレードが簡素な分、感動的でした。,Tripadvisor
"The overall experience is what you can expect from Disneyland parks except a few things...
First - impossible to buy a ticket online of you don’t own a japanese bank card. We live in Japan right now but own a french bank card (VISA). Contacted the customer service, but no solution was proposed and we had to contact a ticket booker and pay more to get tickets. Surprising as it’s Disneyland.

During our day in the park, we had some weird experiences. When in lines, we constantly got interupted by staff asking to stay on floor marks to respect social distancing (we were respecting social distancing and it was obviously meant to make us feel uncomfortable...).

In the haunted mansion, I stopped just a few seconds in the stretch room to have a quick look at the decor. Immediately, the staff lady ran to me and asked me to move away and to keep walking. (Making the « move away » gesture with her hands). As if I was doing something really really bad.

Same happened in Big thunder moutain.

At night, during the parade, as we got closer to the show, a staff lady in charge of social distancing stopped us (she litteraly blocked me by standing before me). Only us. When I asked why. She answered « please stop ». I asked again. She answered « social distancing ». People were keeping on passing by / watching the show but us two had to walk back. No effort were made to communicate in simple japanese or english...

I am more than concerned and thankful for all the work they are doing right now with the covid situation. But it shouldn’t allow weird / unfair behaviors that make us feel as bad or very rude people... Anyway, that’s the first time in my life I feel embarrassed in a disneyland park.

It’s a small world after all - but behave with caution if you are a foreigner right now (and even if it’s your birthday 👍🏻)",Tripadvisor
"Both kids and adults will love this place! I didn’t think I will enjoy as much as I did! I was even a little bit emotional, nearly cried(tears of Joy!) when the parade started! Haha! The lights parade was amazing! We traveled in Dec 2019 and I’m just writing this review now so I actually don’t remember the rides that we took but I still remember the joyful feeling. Even just strolling the place was great! ❤️

The only downside when we were there is that the Disney castle was closed. So that’s sad but overall still a great experience!",Tripadvisor

"I brought my daughter to Tokyo Disneyland. Although this was not our first visit, it was however, our first attempt to wanting to take a picture with the mascots, in particular, Cinderella’s Fairy God Mother.

Never In my wildest dream did I expect racial discrimination from the well known and loved Japanese hospitality.

The Fairy God Mother and her attendants literally bypassed us when it came to our turn after queueing. Not once, but throughout the entire allocated time, only picking the Japanese guests.
We were thoroughly shocked and traumatised by this outright display of discrimination.

The representatives had shattered a child’s dream of a kind fairy god mother and the image of Disneyland, where dreams come true in the Land of Happiness. It was simply heartbreaking.

I was trained in the service industry with a Japanese Airline previously as cabin crew, and I understand fully well the importance of customer satisfaction in the Japanese context.
Disneyland Tokyo totally lacked professionalism in this aspect.

This incident had been extremely disappointing and had left us with a very bitter aftertaste.",Tripadvisor

マスク着用必須、入口での検温、アトラクション出口やショップでの消毒液設置、アトラクションやレストランの座席間隔を開けるなどの対策がとられていました。しかし待機列が長い場合、管理が行き届いていないのと、人通りの多いところでの食べ歩きが多いのとで不安を感じることもありました。ディズニー側だけでなく、客側の意識がとても重要になってきます。

▼新アトラクション
2つとも入場してすぐにエントリーパスが取れました。どちらも9時台のエントリーパスでしたが、結局その時間から20分程度待ちました。9時前に入場するのであれば、新アトラクションは午後でエントリーパスをとってといて、最も待ち時間の長いスプラッシュマウンテンを先に攻略した方がいいかも。

▼食事
1つのレストランあたり1、2つのメニューしかない。そしてほとんどのメニューに肉が入っており、肉類が食べられない私は大変苦労しました。夜ごはんが食べられず、とてもひもじい思いをしたので、星1つ減らしました。好嫌いやアレルギーがある方は、事前にメニューを調べ行くレストランについて複数候補を決めておくと良いでしょう。そして当日の営業時間を調べておくこと(短縮されているところが多い)。

▼その他
FPが使えない分、待ち時間は増えた印象です。それでも朝8：30夜20：00までいて18回アトラクションに乗れたので大満足です。コロナ禍でのストレス発散にとても良かったです。また不安がある中で明るくにこやかにおもてなしをして下さっているキャストの皆さんに感謝です！

"予約チケットで11時から入園して新しく出来た美人と野獣を目的に行きました。入園してすぐにエントリーするものの全てがアウトでした。
せっかく遠くから来て高いチケット買ってもうガッカリでした。せめてお城だけでも写真を撮ろうと思っても線を引かれて少し近くに行く事も出来ないし
今まで何十回と行きましたが本当にガッカリでした。スタッフの質も落ちているしコロナで入場制限してるの？人が多すぎてそれも驚きでした！
ファーストパスをなくしてますがあった方が密にならず時間も分散されていいと思いますね。

"鬼嫁がチケットを取ったため、２年ぶりにTDLに行くことに。
ここ３回の訪問は海外のディズニーでしたが、
そこと比べても待ち時間が少なかったので、私のTDL史上では最高でした。

色々な制限が有りましたが、ディスニー大好き人間ではないので
それほど苦ではありませんでした。
ただ、グリーティングのソーシャルディスタンスにはびっくり！
出来上がったのは、
５歳の娘とミッキーの距離が約２メートルの写真でした。

また、少しでも新エリアの当選の可能性を増やすために、
早めに行って入園と共にアクセス。
何を根拠にそれを鬼嫁がやったのかは分かりませんが、
新エリアのベルのアトラクションとベイマックスのアトラクションと
ミッキーのグリーティングに当たりました。ミニーはハズレ。
（単なる運だとは思いますが、一応参考までに・・・）

あと、この時期だからほとんどが日本人で
もともとマナーも良く、キャストの言うことは聞く・守るので、
それを見ていて日本人として誇らしく心地よかったです。
ちなみに鬼嫁は直近三回の海外ディズニーで
毎回安定的に外人と場所取りによるトラブルを起こしています。

それから、頑張っているキャストさんにはありがとうと言いたいです。",Tripadvisor

"予約チケットの割には混雑していていました。
アトラクションの消毒は降りた時のみ、乗るときの消毒やスタッフが拭くようなこともなかったです。
離れて乗るようなこともなく別のグループがすぐ後ろに乗っています。並んでいる時もすぐ後ろに人がいて黄色いテープなんて全く守っていません。
スタッフが少ないのでチェックしきれない様子でした。
外で食べるテーブルにもスタッフが拭くようなこともなかったです。（自分で除菌シートで拭きましたが）
ワールドバザールのショップ内も混雑気味、レジのところだけソーシャルディスタンス？
感染対策はしっかり出来ていると人づてに聞き予定通り行きましたが心配になる事がたくさんありました。
ミッキーにはあっという間のパレードで見ただけ。
残念ながら今の入園料は高く感じました。",Tripadvisor
"他の方もおっしゃっていますが、キャストの質低下にガッカリ、驚きます。
昔は憧れであったディズニーキャストでしたが、今は普通の飲食店以下の対応
「感じが悪い」人の方が多いです。
キャスト同士での私語は当たり前、「この後マック行く？」って話してました。
期間限定のフードをどこで売っているか、ワゴンキャストに質問した際も
「ここにはないです。どこに売ってるかは地図に書いてあると思います」で終わり。見てもわからないから聞いてるんですが。。笑
いくら人員不足とはいえ、ここまで質が低下してしまうものでしょうか？
新エリアの導入などでコストがかさんでいるのはわかりますが
ゲスト側からすると、「料金は上がっている」のに「混んでいて乗れない」「キャストの質が低下している」で、これで満足度なんて上げられるわけないと思います。
経営層はしっかりと今の実態に向き合い、考えてほしいと思います。",Tripadvisor
"Très jolie parc, ressemble un peu à son cousin le Magic Kingdom à WDW, notamment le château et la maison hanté qui sont quasiment identique, il y a bien sur quelques différences notables à commencer par la rue principal qui est couverte sous une grande serre, pratique les jours de pluie.
Le quartier Fantasyland est très cheap par contre, surtout les attraction comme Peter Pan Fly la façade fait très fête foraine c'est vraiment dommage quand on voit tout le reste.. (c'est d'ailleurs pour ça que j'enlève un point), mais ils sont en train de le transformer normalement, il était temps.
Mention spécial à l'attraction Winnie l'ourson qui est génial avec le véhicule qui sautille, dance,.. et le Pop Corn à la sortie de l'attraction avec du miel, une tuerie, ça a le gout de mes céréales d'enfance qui n'existe plus (Kix).
La parade électrique le soir est géniale !",Tripadvisor
"緊急事態宣言中であったため、入場者は5,000人だったので気持ち良いぐらいすいすいとアトラクションを利用できました。美女と野獣、ベイマックスは少し時間を要しました。エントリー制でした。",Tripadvisor
TDLは園内の掃除も行き届いて清潔で植木や草花もきちんと剪定されていて、スモールワールドやカリブの海賊の水も綺麗。お土産のお菓子やグッズも本当に感心するほど凝っていて買い物が楽しい。従業員も昔のTDLに比べ、ゆとり世代だから？サービスの質が確実に落ちているのは確かですがパリのディズニーランドに比べれば全然良い。パリはパレードなど夢中で見ていると子連れだろうが財布をすられます。パーク内のレストランもパリのディズニーに比べたらまだ美味しい方。,Tripadvisor
この時期、遠方組の私は誰も誘えるはずもなく、こっそり１人ディズニーです。入場制限真っ只中ということで、多くのお店やレストランは休業、ほとんどのショーも中止の中、アトラクションはほぼ通常営業でした。１人だと自分のペースで好きに過ごせる一方で、列に並ぶ時はどうしても居心地の悪い時間となります。ちょっぴり寂しいのはもちろんのこと、空いたスペースに割り込まれたり押されたり何かと迫害を受けがちです。それが今回は地面に引かれた黄色い線のおかげで、何の心配も無く、また待ち時間もないので寂しさを感じるヒマがないくらいでした。ナイトフォール・グロウ（夜のパレード短い版）では、フロートが来る直前でも最前列の場所が取れ、１人１人の間隔が広いので、キャラクターが自分に手を振ってくれているのがはっきり分かり、喜びもひとしおでした。 コロナ前は、前泊して早朝から開園待ち。場所取りが必要なショーは諦め、綿密なスケジュール管理でファストパスやレストラン予約を駆使して挑み、22時退園時には戦いきった達成感を味わう一方でクタクタに疲れきっていました。今回は当日朝一福岡発の便でも開園前到着。園内の散策を楽しみながら、通りかかったアトラクションに気の向くままに乗り、お腹がすいたらお食事。夜7時の閉園でも時間は充分でした。いつもは寝るだけだった退園後のホテルでもゆっくり過ごすことができました。めったに来園できない遠方組からすると、チケットが高くてもいいのである程度すいているパークが望ましいのですが、そういう訳にもいかないのでしょうね。もう二度とないであろう貴重な体験となりました。,Tripadvisor
"美女と野獣は抽選当たったがベイマックスは外れ。
美女と野獣が目的だったので、まあ良しとした。
美女と野獣の入場時間に行くと、ベルのドレスを着た子供がお城を眺めながら泣いてた。
おそらく抽選に外れたのだろう、親とスタッフが必死に慰めていた。
かわいそうに。
子供チケットは抽選無しで入れてあげればいいのに。",Tripadvisor

"千葉県に適用されているまん延防止等重点措置に従って、TDL・TDSとも入園者数の上限を5,000人として運営されています。ステイホームの運動不足解消と気分転換を兼ね、久しぶりに訪れました。平常時の8分の1程度ですのでガラガラです。
昨年秋から利用人数を制限するため、一部のアトラクションやキャラクターグリーティングを体験するには、エントリー受付を行うシステムになっています。アプリで利用したい施設と時間を申込むものですが、開園待ちをしている時やパーク外からエントリーすることはできませんので、入園したらまず初めにエントリーをお勧めします。抽選結果にかかわらず各施設1日1回のみで、落選した場合でも再エントリー不可ですので、慌てずに気持ちを切りかえて他の申込をすると良いです。
当選するとエントリーした時間帯（1～2時間）の中から利用可能時刻（〇時〇分～〇時〇分）が指定されますが、利用可能時刻内にアトラクション等が終了する訳ではないので、前後の予定を注意しないと当選が無効になってしまいます。
今回は運よく「美女と野獣〝魔法のものがたり″」、「ベイマックスのハッピーライド」、「ミニーのスタイルスタジオ」のエントリー受付に当選しました。アトラクションは合計16、キャラクターグリーティングは3つ体験でき、今まで訪れた中でも断トツの記録です。
入園の際には、体温測定と手荷物検査に多少時間がかかり、若干の行列ができていましたが、アトラクションの待ち時間は長くても20分程度で、ストレスフリーで安心して楽しめました。まだまだ営業していないレストランやショップも散見されました。通常であれば計画的に慌ただしく行動しがちですが、時間を気にせず散歩気分でゆったりと過ごせリフレッシュできました。",Tripadvisor

Free gifts (1/200 Gundam) were given at the entrance. The Gundam will be awaken twice in every hour with a timetable. U can go up to the dock but tickets were all sold out when i went. There is a Gundam store where you can buy souvenirs. Too bad that the Gundam will be taken down by the end of Mar 2023.,Tripadvisor
We went to check out the 18m tall Gundam. My boys do not know much about Gundam but they were fascinated to see Gundam move. It’s very well done with great background music and sound. The museum offers a lot of extra information about the project. It also has a shop selling Gundam souvenir at a reasonable price.,Tripadvisor
The nearest exit is motomachi mirai station and then walked about 10 mins then you will see a park and it actually located inside the park but in the pier next to it. From afar you will see the Gundam factory logo and walking further in will be able to see the moving gundam. The entrance cost 1650 yen and the viewing dock cost 3300 yen. Reach there 11.30am and the viewing dock are sold out so suggest to get it online or be the 1st to reach attraction to get view dock ticket.,Tripadvisor

"原本展期只至2023年3月31日的橫濱高達工廠。
位於橫濱港未來的「Gundam Factory Yokohama」
將延長至2024年3月31日，當然要把握時間去朝聖一下吧。
平日11點才開始，假日時間會早1小時。如果想看日間 + 夜間 Gundam 建議晚點來。另外因為位於海邊的關係，那邊就是超大風，很開揚而且很曬。

門票可以即場買，普通入場門票 (JPY 1650)
如果您想上去高達旁的展望台就要加購 (JPY 3300) 認真覺得滿貴的。問去過的朋友意見也說沒需要上展望台，因為中間其實隔住一塊玻璃，吸引度更低。要注意7月22至9月3日期間入場更會送入場特典，每日限定1000個的模型。

我是大概中午12點半到，只需要排隊買門票後就可以直接入場。
最先看到 HARO 爆谷筒，滿可愛但不知買來有什麼用。
如果想買 HARO 週邊亦可以去 GUNDAM Café，那裡的水樽連飲品是商店沒賣的。每款 (還有高達款) JPY 1400 - Yellow Lemonade & Blue Soda亦有 HARO 造型的 Pancake (JPY 650) 味道一般。

來這裡最重要的當然便是看 1:1 實際大小的初代鋼彈RX-78F00！
不止在遠方已經能感受到巨大的存在感，最讓人期待是會動起來的！全身具備 24 處可動部位，所以四肢均能動。
不同的姿勢配合原聲優的配音，是粉絲的話怎可以錯過呢。
順帶一說，我選了在 Cafe 出面的看台去觀看。

現場更設有「 GUNDAM-LAB 」，當中展示為了實現可動鋼彈所應用的各種機器人工學技術等資料，極具意義。參觀完這個還可以逛商店，最終逗留了大約1個半小時左右。",Tripadvisor

"平和記念公園は、旧太田川(本川)が元安川と分岐する三角州の最上流部に位置し、原爆死没者の慰霊と世界恒久平和を祈念して開設された都市公園です。
この場所は、江戸時代から昭和初期に至るまで広島市の中心的な繁華街でしたが、昭和20年(1945年)8月6日に人類史上初めて落とされた一発の原子爆弾により、一瞬のうちに破壊されました。しかし、被ばくから二～三ヶ月後には、タンポポとコスモスが咲きました。生命力ある花が咲いたことで、市民は勇気づけられたとのことです
被爆後、昭和24年(1949年)8月6日に公布された「広島平和記念都市建設法」に基づき、爆心地周辺を恒久平和の象徴の地として整備するため、昭和25年(1950年)から平和記念公園及び施設の建設が進められ、昭和30年(1955年)に完成しました。
公園内には、原爆ドーム、広島平和記念資料館、平和の願いを込めて設置された数々のモニュメント、被爆したアオギリなどがあります。毎年8月6日には平和記念式典が開催され原爆が投下された午前8時15分には黙祷が捧げられる。式典では、市内中学校、高校の吹奏楽部による「ひろしま平和の歌」の伴奏、広島市の合唱団等による合唱が行われる。",Tripadvisor

Whether you also ask for a guide (which is a free service available from inside the museum building, just ask at the desk) or just wander round the park by yourself, it’s a fitting place to remember the many victims of the Hiroshima A-bomb, both those that died immediately and those who died even years afterwards from radiation exposure related conditions, and to contemplate the importance of peace. Do not miss this during your visit to Hiroshima.",Tripadvisor

"The Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park is a memorial to the victims of the atomic bomb that devastated the city in 1945, and has a number of monuments throughout the park.

The A-Bomb Dome, which stands as a stark reminder of the destructive power of nuclear weapons is across the river from the Peace Memorial Park and a stark reminder of the destructive power of nuclear weapons.

There is also the Peace Memorial Museum, which offers an account of the events leading up to the bombing and its aftermath.

The park is a reminder of the folly of mankind's past and of hope for a peaceful future. It is a humbling experience to visit this location, and serves as a testament to the resilience of the spirit of the Japanese people in the face of tragedy.",Tripadvisor

"A tranquil green space between two rivers that was once the site of an unprecedented tragedy, Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park is an essential part of understanding Hiroshima City’s history.

Before the bomb, the area of what is now the Peace Park was the political and commercial heart of the city. For this reason, it was chosen as the pilot's target. Four years to the day after the bomb was dropped, it was decided that the area would not be redeveloped but instead devoted to peace memorial facilities.

All of the park’s memorials are within walking distance from each other, so when visiting allow yourself time to stroll around and view them all and take time to reflect.

The most popular sights are : The A-Bomb Dome, The Flame of Peace, Memorial Monument, Memorial Tower, Sankichi Tōge Monument, Children’s Peace Monument, and Peace Bell.

We were there at the beginning of Covid in March 2020 and sadly, the museum was closed. I was really disappointed but there was enough in the park to understand the destruction.

It was so emotional and overwhelming, that we took a break for lunch and came back to continue.

There is a lot to take in and read. It is very moving and a sombre atmosphere. Everyone who comes to Japan should come here to understand the history and the scale of the human tragedy in WWII.

Take one of the sightseeing loop buses (meipurū-pu) from Hiroshima Station. It gives information on the specific sites.",Tripadvisor

(+) The park itself is quite expansive. It could definitely be a full day's event, especially if you visit the museum.
(+) There are loads of statues, towers, and significant markers spread across the park, so there is something to see / read / learn at every turn.
(+) There is so much open space, it's an ideal place for a picnic. Bring a blanket and pick up some food and enjoy the scenery. There are also many benches along the river facing the Atomic Bomb Dome.
(+) There are clean public toilets throughout the park and a few vending machines with drinks.
(+) Even thought the site has a horrific historical significance, it's remarkably peaceful and beautiful

"this place is good for family outings. at the same time remember the cruelty to humanity. the very horror happened in this place is now one of the most peaceful place in hiroshima city. absolutely worth the visit. cater for at least 4 hours to absorb in the museum trip and time to run around with taking photos and even picnic. plenty of eatery nearby too. Hiroshima Peace museum is worth a visit, however certain sections of the museum is unsuitable for you d children.
(Museum ticket pricing: ¥400 for adults and ¥200 for children. More like a token than to pay to keep the museum alive.)

"Located directly opposite to Inari metro station, it's a mere 1-min walk here.

This is a beautiful shrine that is big. Founded back in 711 by the Hata family, the Fushimi Inari is the oldest and possibly the most prominent shrine in Kyoto.

It is famous for its tunnels of more than 10,000 closely-spaced vermilion torii gates that wind over the hills of Mount Inari beyond the entrance to the shrine. And they have become the key photostop of the shrine.

On the day of our visit, it was very crowded (there's also a makeshift food street, just outside the shrine that attracted many people too) and we tried to walk along the main tunnels. It's nice and walking in was more challenging than walking out (as were walking upslope).

Although it was sunny, it was cooling then as there were lots of trees and greenery and just near the mountain.

It's definitely a must to visit here!",Tripadvisor

"Nous y sommes allés à 16h un mercredi 27 septembre soit 2 jours avant le début des vacances de la golden week en Chine et il n'y avait pas énormément de monde comme je le craignais d'après les avis. Après c'est sûr que lorsqu'on est redescendu il faisait déjà la nuit mais comme il y a un éclairage ce n'est pas trop gênant. Le sommet proprement dit n'a pas grand intérêt, on y retrouve un de ces nombreux temples montés en sorte de parpaings de ciment et des mini porte Torii déposées par les croyants. Donc quand vous vous retrouvez sur un croisement à gauche il y a un chemin qui monte sur un petit temple avec derrière le point de vue le plus haut sur la ville ou alors à droite la direction vers le sommet. Il y en a aussi un en face en direction du sommet mais a priori plus long car il s'agit d'une boucle mais c'est difficile d'en être bien sûr car les indications ne sont pas très claires. Sinon pensez à prendre des pièces de 100 yens 7 billets de 1000¥ car il y a des distributeurs automatiques de boissons mais qui ne prennent pas les grosses coupures.

However in 30 degrees heat it is hard to be enthusiastic about doing that. The street below the shrine is mobbed, literally.",Tripadvisor

"It is beautiful, without a doubt. My recommendation is to go in winter and go as early as possible. Even in the middle of February you have to wade through thousands of tourists who do not understand that it is rude to stop in the middle of a narrow path when there are hundreds of people behind you. The ambiance is entirely ruined by cellphones.

If you do go I recommend doing the entire circuit up the mountain and back. Most tourists do not make it that far so it is much quieter the further up you go.",Tripadvisor
"This is a very beautiful place and definitely worth a visit. There are just too many people and it’s difficult to take photos without anyone in the background.

If you walk right up to the top, the crowd thins out and the views are incredible. Be prepared for some serious walking uphill though.",Tripadvisor

Pour éviter le monde, nous sommes arrivés à 7h du matin et ça a été une réussite puisque nous pouvions nous balader, et prendre de magnifiques photos, quasiment seuls.

"GUIDE TO FUSHIMI INARI SHRINE

Half day guide with map, food and photos to experience Fushimi Inari to its fullest.

TABLE OF CONTENT:

Best time of day to visit
Food recommendations
Unique Souvenirs
Photo opportunities
Hidden gems and extras

If you need to read only one thing out of this, is that I recommend visiting the shrine in the evening and not morning time. For the simple reason that you do not want to miss out on the beautiful sunset at the top of the summit, the best lighting on the torii gates, and the magic transition to night time with all the lamps lighting up that in itself, is a unique experience people pay tourguides for.

BEST TIME OF DAY TO VISIT:

Contradictory to ALL the guides out there, I recommend starting out around 3-4 hours before sunset so you can enjoy a hearty lunch, spend time at the souvenir stalls and take as many pictures as you want without rush before sunset on the mountaintop.

You wont miss out on photos by yourself between the gates even later in the day near the mountaintop, where the crows thin out, and more photo opportunities open up.

After sunset descend the left side of the mountaintop loop to enjoy the mystical forest by yourself, as not everybody knows the path gets lit up by hundreds of lights.

FOOD RECOMMENDATIONS:

Although the many stalls along the shrine entrance are great, and the few and far food stands on the mountain are present.
I personally prefer to have a proper meal sitting down with drinks and plates.

For that one I recommend the delicious ''Gyukatsu Kyoto Katsugyu''(see food photos) in itself a fun experience where for around 2000 yen (13 USD) you get a plate of tonkatsu, rice, miso and several dipping sauces to enjoy every bite differently.

After, for those with a sweet tooth, I recommend stopping at the highly awarded and 5 star reviewed icecream shop right across the street ''Nishimura Gelato Factory''.

I am a gelato aficionado and I recommend vividly ALL their flavours, especially their special matcha, which won many awards and is more balanced than other matchas out there that I've tried.

At the end of your day, after the visit, most of the places will have closed, so I recommend ''Ramen Hiwamatanoboru'' (see food photos) for a killer tsukemen (dipping noodles) at a great price.

UNIQUE SOUVENIRS

Now on the way to the shrine and the top of the mountain there will be thousands of souvenirs you can buy, but NOTHING will be as unique as a goshuin made by one of the shrine monks.

For those unfamiliar, a goshuin is a handpainted seal unique to shinto and buddhist temples, with each having its own design, usually costing between 300 to 1000 yen, depending on compleixity.

Given you do not have the special book needed (called goshuin-cho), the monk will provide you with one for 2300 yen, and can be used at every shrine or temple you visit. And as a personal note, the goshuin-cho from the Inari shrine is one of the prettiest I've seen out there.

It can be found at the buildings on the left of the entrance of the main shrine (see GOSHUIN on map)

PHOTO OPPORTUNITIES

There are several spots for amazing photo opportunities, with most ones without people being towards the mountaintop.

Your first stop will be at ""Kumataka Shrine"" on the ""Shin-Ike pond"" (see blue trail on map), where by keeping the pond on your left, following along a series of narrower paths, you will end up on a tiny dirt trail, follow it until reaching a tiny gray building for photos like the one I posted (see the shrine on the pond photo).

The second stop will be at sunset, all along the Torii right before AND after the Kyoto Viewpoint (see red trail on map and viewpoint) at ""Fushimi Inari Yotsuji"". The sun will be hitting in between the torii, giving the best lighting and no strong shadows allowing for picture perfect portraits. (see the portrait photos)
You can also enjoy the sunset over the mountains at the viewpoint if you prefer, but be mindful reaching this area takes up to two hours more or less, depending on your speed and if stopping for photos.

The third photo opportunities (see night photos) will be after sunset along the left side of the mountaintop loop (see black trail on map), where hundreds of lamps will light your path to the bottom of the mountain. Do take time and explore the side roads popping up here and there, being careful to avoid any suspicious sounds as yokais and boars are known to roam the area and feeding on unsuspecting tourists.

HIDDEN GEMS & EXTRAS

Although bathrooms are indicated throughout the on situ map, most of them are closed, so I recommend using the ones at the start of the trail before heading up.

Remember to follow etiquette and wash your hands and rinse your mouth (not drink) at the fountain to purify yourself before climbing up. And to keep the left side of the road when walking in Japan (even if most people will not).

Everybody is there to take photos, so be mindful to not run through somebody else's picture and be patient, you will be rewarded with the same kindness usually.

For all the hidden gems I recommend visiting ''The unknown sites of Fushimi Inari Shrine in Kyoto'' on the ''How To Japan'' website.

The most important one will be the fortune telling stones ""Omokaru Stones"" found behind the ""Okusha Hohaisho"" shrine (see map for Okusha Hohaisho shrine)

Where a pair of Toro (Japanese lanterns) will have a lucky stone on top that will tell you whether your dreams are easy to achieve or not.

To use them, bow to the lantern formulating a yes or no question in your mind (Will I marry soon?/Can I be rich?/ Will I live a long life?)

Then grab the stone with both hands and guess whether it will be light or heavy, and then lift it.

If the stone is lighter than you thought, then, it means your goal will be easy to achieve, but, if it is heavier, then it will be difficult.

Usually these stones get crowded, so for another pair follow the white trail on the map to a hidden shrine (Fushimi Kandakara Shrine) where the stones are in the shape of a dragon. It can easily be reached by following the Torii gates after the first set of stones, and taking the first trail on the right.

"The 6th August 1945 was a day that changed the course of world history; for Japan; and specifically Hiroshima. Today we spent the morning visiting the Peace Memorial Park area, where we were able to reflect on this event.
We saw a lot, starting with the actual Atomic Bomb Dome (the sole building remaining from that fateful day). It was situated under (what is known as) the Hypocentre (the bomb actually exploded ~600ft above this point. We then moved on to various other sights around the area - all excellent and well worth the time to visit.",Tripadvisor

"While the statue of the loyal dog, Hachiko, is a tourist attraction in terms of the lines of folks awaiting their turn for a selfie, the story of the dog’s loyalty to its owner is truly inspiring.",Tripadvisor

Émouvant et fun. On tombe dessus à une des sorties de métro ! On fait une petite file d'attente pour prendre la pose à ses côtés ! Avant de monter au Starbuck pour prendre son cliché de Shibuya Crossing !,Tripadvisor
Nice statue representing a story of a dog who waited for his master in this very spot. If you get up early pre-7am you'll have this statue to yourself. Later in the day this place fills up and is jammed pack with people waiting to take a picture with it as well as thousands of commuters.,Tripadvisor
"The loyal family member Hachiko statue is right at Shibuya crossing - a well formed line governed by tourists themselves occurs to step up and grab photos. It a must as you pass it by, although it is just a statue after all :)

Although being a lover of dogs/animals, it was only fair to pay my respects.",Tripadvisor
La estatua del perro Hachiko es un lugar que hay que visitar y fotografiar. Su historia es increíble y demuestra la fidelidad a su dueño. Le estuvo esperando durante nueve años en la entrada del transporte público donde le dejó su dueño quien nunca volvió debido a que ese día falleció de un infarto. Hachiko no se movió durante ese tiempo hasta que falleció. En su recuerdo se erigió esta estatua,Tripadvisor
"A must to visit if you are in Tokyo as Hachiko was one loyal Akita who was always at Shibuya Station everyday afterwork to greet his owner even when his owner was deceased. His continuous dedication to wait day after day continued into his own death.
If you want to avoid a long queue getting a picture of Hachiko's famous statue, it is best to arrive early in the morning by 8:309a.m. We arrived on a Sunday morning ~8:45a.m., and was basically only around one or two others there. What a difference an hour made as the crowed had arrived.
Just take the Hachiko Exit at the Shibuya Station, follow Google maps and you will arrive there without any issues! Definitely worth a detour over to Hachiko before you attempt the Shibuya Crossing!!",Tripadvisor
Je n'ai jamais aimé cette statue... c'est encore pire maintenant qu'une règle tacite (?) impose de faire la queue pour la toucher et faire une photo avec... la fin d'une époque !,Tripadvisor
"There’s so many people going in so many directions it was amazing just to watch. Didn’t want to be a tourist, but really couldn’t help myself. And then we got into the action ourselves. Yes, it was organized chaos. You have one minute to get where you’re going and then the lights change.",Tripadvisor
Impressionante la marea di persone che di muove appena scatta il verde in questo incrocio di Tokyo che è il più trafficato del mondo.,Tripadvisor
"Imperdible . El cruce peatonal más grande del mundo . Es lindo ir temprano, qué hay poca gente para recorrer tranquilo , y a la noche es la mejor parte , donde están todos los carteles encendidos que le dan un toque muy peculiar.
Se llega muy fácilmente desde cualquier punto de Tokio",Tripadvisor
"Lugar inesquecível ao visitar Tóquio. A organização para o avanço dos pedestres e dos carros chama muito a atenção, mas passa pela educação de todos que cooperam e não se exaltam em esperar a sua vez. Este é o famoso cruzamento mais movimentado do mundo!",Tripadvisor
It's just a crossing lots of people walking for the 25 ft lol if your just comeing here for that than forget it the only reason why it's busy,Tripadvisor

We went once during the day and once at night (we preferred nighttime). It’s worth visiting just to marvel at the people and lights. Doesn’t take long out of your trip and makes for a good story/pictures/videos.,Tripadvisor
"Wow what an experience. Masses of people waiting patiently for the lights to change then dodge those coming the other way to get to the other side. Our guide took us over 4 times, but lookout for other tourists with cameras in the air not looking where they’re going.",Tripadvisor
"Tutte le volte che vengo qua, mi capita di passarci. Non so, ma sto posto lo trovo decisamente noioso adesso. 15 anni fa, la prima volta lo trovai esaltante, ma ora, la massa di persone in movimento, è particolare fino ad un certo punto. Tantissimi stranieri, troppi. Questo incrocio e i posti limitrofi, sono peggiorati e se vogliamo, anche leggermente più sporchi. Da visitare una sola volta.",Tripadvisor
"Crossing is very famous, and well worth a visit. We went at 8pm on a Friday night…it was busy but not too busy.

"Eigentlich will jeder Besucher Tokios auch einmal die „Alle gehen“-Kreuzung überqueren.

"The Japanese are really good at advertising the unusual, this is a cross walk and why are we here because it is ""The Busiest in the World"" and were were there as actually we were going to a restaurant there but most of those we saw were just taking photos of the crossing, anyway it was fun being part of the madness, just do it and have fun. You will get a laugh at some of the people there.",Tripadvisor
incrocio insolito dove si attraversa anche in diagonale;divertente vedere così tante persone ed il continuo andirivieni.,Tripadvisor
"There are many similiar crossing in Japan and this was one of the most talked about crossing.

A crowd pushing crossing in Shibuya and to get the view from the top, we paid SD 30 for 2 pax at Shibuya Corssing View & Rooftop Lounge that comes w a drink.",Tripadvisor
"It’s pretty cool to see, the people look like ants from above. It’s famous for being busy so go if you don’t mind crowds. At the end of the day it is just a crossing so don’t have high expectations. (I only took videos so I don’t have any photos)",Tripadvisor
"As one walks closer and closer to this area, the crowd and press of people intensifies. Locals and visitors congregate in the area and take pics for their feeds. Personally don't see the great draw for this multi-crossing. Crossings like these are becoming more and more popular around the world. Sure, it's cool to watch the ants cross but really folks?!?

Would I visit again...NO! It's a miss.

I would rather examine the mural ""Myth of Tomorrow"" created by Taro Okamoto which is located in the train concourse above the crossing. Check it out and read about it.",Tripadvisor
"We went to Sibuya to see the crossing and it was so underwhelming. Just a big crossing with lots of people, and even more trying to photograph them. You can’t really see anything at ground level. We went to an overpass in the train station but it wasn’t very interesting to watch. Maybe it’s worth seeing from the tower but you’ll need to reserve entrance tickets in advance",Tripadvisor
"An absolute must when in Tokyo. We crossed the street several times and at different angles. To see it on youtube is one thing but to actually do it, is awesome!",Tripadvisor
"Interesting area but not worth all the hype! Made for some amazing photos of me for the gram though haha!

It is surrounded by high end shops and the billboards make the area really pop. Quite the iconic place but not worth visiting purely for the crossing.",Tripadvisor
"I enjoyed this more than I reasonably should have. It’s a crossing with loads of people. Not sure why, but I got the biggest kick doing it once, I did it a second time then went into the train station on the second floor and watched people cross the street. Definitely pause to observe when in Shibuya, which is a neighborhood that has so much to offer.",Tripadvisor

"If you ever watched films like Braveheart or the Lord of the Rings in which two armies face each other and then suddenly start running into each other - here you can experience it live (without the fighting of course).
The shopping streets around here are also an amazing experience for people watching and being carried away by all the neon lights. We loved the „LABI“ electronics store top floor - seeing all the toys here you really want to be a child again. For food, go to UOBEI around the corner for some space sushi experience.",Tripadvisor

"Finché non ci ho messo entrambi i piedi, pensavo che venire fin qui fosse, se non proprio una perdita di tempo, una banalità: malgrado l'enfasi delle guide, non pensavo che la vista dell'incrocio pedonale più frequentato del mondo fosse un'esperienza di un seppur minimo significato - a parte il piacere di vedere la statua del mitico cane Hachiko, che ricordavo celebrato da un bel film con Richard Gere. Invece, malgrado la folla e il frastuono dei grandi autobus pubblicitari che solcano le vie tutto intorno sparando le loro musichette a tutto volume, ammetto che questo spazio fra gli incombenti grattacieli mi ha provocato una sensazione. Non saprei come definirla: non sconcerto, non certo esaltazione; ma è stato un po' come sentire con forza lo spirito del tempo presente, con la sua smisuratezza e l'intensità a tratti frenetica. Non è qualcosa che mi piaccia; anzi, nel fondo rappresenta un modo di essere a cui sono ostile; ma è in occasioni come questa che capisco di non potergli essere estraneo.",Tripadvisor
"This place does live up to its hype; there is a lot of people and I love the energy of the crowd 🥰 Tourists, locals, students, working adults; everyone comes by here and the atmosphere is great!

This park in the heart of Hiroshima is a quiet space that is good for reflection and has views of the A bomb site. There are many monuments and museums within the park which all offer insight into the bombing.,Tripadvisor
This was a sobering experience and well worth the trip to Hiroshima just to experience it. The peace park itself was stunning with cherry blossoms and lovely manicured gardens. There are incredible monuments built to honour those lost. The museum and the dome are both attached to the park. The dome itself is incredible - to look at something that stood at that time is amazing. The museum is as you’d expect - a very serious exhibition that stays with you.,Tripadvisor
"We visited the Peace Park and the museum. Very moving experience to see how the people of Hiroshima suffered because of their country’s actions.

It is hard to imagine how they suffered and the displays are very descriptive and some very upsetting.

If you go independently you can get a free volunteer guide to take you around and explain everything you see, which is excellent to enable you to understand what happened and the ongoing effects on the people of Hiroshima even today",Tripadvisor
A big park that is about 2km from Hiroshima station. There is a ferry from miyajima that stop directly at the park. It can also be reached via tram.,Tripadvisor
"This is a well kept park, that is worth a stroll through whilst contemplating the events of 6th August 1945 at 08:15 when the atomic bomb exploded just above the, now, skeletal remains of the dome. There is a peace bell that you can ring, there are queues at busy times, very sombre and moving.",Tripadvisor
…for anyone visiting Hiroshima and all very respectfully realised. The atmosphere was somber rather than morbid as it’s all very well explained and spaced out for people to learn and pay their respects.,Tripadvisor
"One of the most memorable walks in a place that has been set aside to remind the world the folly of war. Walked across Aioi Bridge over Honkawa River to Red Bird Literary monument and then to the historic remains of A-bombed Dome building. Passed the rose garden where rose plants donated by most nations are planted,passing Citizen's Peace Clock to Motoyasu bridge to children's peace monument. The monument commemorates a young girl who died of leukaemia ( caused by radiation) and thousands of other children who died. The young died ten years after the bomb. She kept folding paper cranes (symbol of good luck) hoping to get better. News of her story spread and now around 10 million paper cranes are received here every year.
From here walk across the road to Flame of Peace. Erected in 1964 in stylised expression of hands joined at the wrists and palms open to the sky to comfort the victims of the bomb who developed an unquenchable thirst.The flame was lit in 1964 as an aspiration for anti-nuclear world. Set in a water feature, surrounded by a tree lined path on either side, which represents the water that the victims needed.
the path leads to Hiroshima Victims Memorial Cenotaph with Peace Park on either side which leads to the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum.
From the first floor of the museum there is straight line of vision to Cenotaph, Peace Flame, Children's Memorial and the bombed remains of the Dome. Very moving.",Tripadvisor

"It is a beautiful memorial park - it was very moving. We walked around the memorial park and the museum. Both are a must-see.

          This park is ooened in 1954, dedicated  to the memories of the victims of the fallout of nuclear bombing in the town on 6th August 1945.  
          We visited this place during our recent trip to Japan. The park houses the famous A Bomb Dome, a Centograph, children's peace monument.  This monument displays a girl's statue with raised arms holding a paper crane. The girl , Sadako Sasaki, died of nuclear radiation. During her period of disease, she folded mire than 1000 paper cranes. The Peace Museum also is housed in thus park. The visit to this park makes one sad but put also in front of tithe reality of human cruelty.

"The visit to the park was a sombre experience. It took us about 3-4 hours to visit and the area, which gave us enough time to appreciate the memorial, and the stories of the survivors.

It’s rather crowded, as there were some school groups. However, we were lucky that on the day we visited it was particularly cold and there was no wait to get into the museum.

We also came back after dark as the some of the buildings are lit beautifully as a memorial.",Tripadvisor
Came here as part of guided tour of Hiroshima and the surrounding areas. Very interesting to see the Atomic Bomb Dome and all the memorials around the park.,Tripadvisor
"Absolutely fascinating, despite the sadness behind the story of Hiroshima. So much so for this writer, I made two visits (there is a great deal to see and take in). I am not even sure where to start. Easy to get to via the Red Bus (No. 2 bus stop at Hiroshima station - bus leaves every hour but check for changes - can also get there via Street Car, as I later found out and is a fun way to get around once one gets the hang of it). The remains of the Dome itself are just astonishing, never mind completely sobering. There are survivors or family members of survivors telling their story at various times in and around the Park. The museum within the Peace Park is worth waiting in a queue to see. The most amazing thing to me was, despite the museum being crammed full with visitors (praying not to acquire COVID) it was absolutely deadly quiet - not one person was playing around with their mobile 'phone, nor talking. There are various memorials a cenotaph and eternal flame in the Park. A small, but really interesting exhibition which was a former house near the epicentre of the blast where there were original remains of the building. I visited also the Victims' memorial hall - a circular building, very peaceful, the walls of which are etched with an outline of the city of Hiroshima. In that same building there was a small theatre which was showing a film about 3 people who worked at the Hiroshima Bureau of Meteorology and their account of what happened on that day - 6th August 1945. After taking in all this sad history I ended up having lunch in a triangular shaped building which I believe was a Kimono shop before the blast. There was also an exhibition under this building which showcased a sealed room that was spared the blast, although the epicentre was some 600 metres away.",Tripadvisor
"This memorial park is a must-see when visiting Hiroshima. The history of the atomic bomb explosion and after-effects were explained at different sites throughout the park with the Atomic Dome being the most recognizable. Ground zero was located around the corner from the dome, near a local hospital marked by a small plaque. A somber place for reflection. We didn't visit the Museum but the line-ups were massive. During the fall, school groups from around Japan often visit the park.",Tripadvisor
Amazingly put together and so heart wrenching. The personal accounts make this moment in history come alive. Absolutely worth it to go see this museum.,Tripadvisor
This wonderful place touches your humanity. Those events of 1945 must never be forgotten. Let us hope current world leaders can put their egos in their pockets and reach out for some much-needed wisdom. Peace and kindness wins.,Tripadvisor
"Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park creates poignant feelings within you, given the tragic history of the place, even though it is well-maintained.",Tripadvisor
"The peace park is very nicely laid out and has some very moving monuments and statues. It is worth queuing to see the eternal flame through the arch, but be respectful as many people come to just pay respects and honour the dead, not take smiling selfies. The dome is poignant and tragically beautiful. Walk all the way around it to appreciate the devastation of this building.",Tripadvisor
Lovely park and monuments to remember those that lost their lives. Not sure it’s a ack for children to be running around and screening as some were.,Tripadvisor
"I had been to Japan many dozens of times for business over forty years but made little time for non-business excursions. The Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park is a stunning place, dedicated to peace and understanding. It is done exceptionally well with so much care going into the design and layout of the park. Enormous thought and planning went into making this Park quiet, peaceful, and a true statement to the horror of the nuclear war and just war itself. If you can make the time, I predict it will affect you quietly and subtly. Breath-taking in so many ways and also stunning in its starkness. If you get to this southern area of Kyushu, I'd highly recommend that you make time; it is moving beyond words.",Tripadvisor
This is an absolute must for people visiting Japan. I’d give yourself about 3 to 4 hours to visit. The park is located about a 15 minute tram ride from Hiroshima’s main train station. You can get a day pass for the tram at the ticket office next to the tram station (just outside the train station). You need a number 6 or 2 tram which will take you to the park. The first thing you’ll see is the Atomic Dome. This is the structure that remained standing in ruins after the bomb exploded 600 metres above it. It’s the one most people will have seen in pictures of the aftermath (now a world heritage site). You can see all around it and take pictures . We also went to a building next to the site called the Hiroshima Orizuro Tower. There is an observation deck on the top floor looking down on the site. Costs about 2200 yen per person to go up. The peace memorial site is exactly as you’d expect. Beautiful and tranquil with places to stop and reflect on the horrors of that day. We also went to the Peace Memorial Museum. It is also a ‘must do’ and the museum goes into detail about what happened with some distressing imagery and artefacts. Be careful what time you go though. We went mid afternoon and it was absolutely rammed. In some areas there were just too many people in such a confined space to be able to properly appreciate what we were seeing. I gave up trying to read the information on the walls as I just couldn’t see with the sheer volume of people in some of the museum areas. It’s still a must do though.,Tripadvisor
"Il parco di per se nulla di eccezionale ma ciò che ti racconta e rivivi ti lascia sbigottito
Occorre oltre al parco visitare pure il museo dove con l’ausilio di audio guide a 400 yen si ascolta una narrazione di ogni singolo ghetto o fotografia",Tripadvisor
Berührende Gedenkstätte. Man sollte unbedingt die free English guided tour des Museeums besuchen und genug Zeit einplanen,Tripadvisor
Well manicured park. It was raining while we visited so we didn't have time to walk through the park. They do a great job of keeping the park clean.,Tripadvisor
"A beautiful park with lots to see from the museum to the dome.

Take your time and visit the children’s shrine and if you’re lucky, some cherry blossoms (early April).

It’s poignant and stirring.",Tripadvisor
"The park includes many aspects related to the WWII bombing that ushered in the nuclear age. Aside from the well-recognized Atomic Bomb Dome, there are memorials to the children and all who died as a result of the bombing, including those who died years later.",Tripadvisor
"The only reason this tourist attraction exists stems from one of the worst human tragedies. It’s a tasteful, respectful and moving tribute to those who lost their lives and those who’s life was effected. Allow plenty of time to appreciate the memorial and tranquility of the park. Our guide Aiko gave us the background and stories. Very moving and not at all morbid. Real people suffer in war and from decisions made by governments and politicians",Tripadvisor
"Recuerdo tratado con mucho respeto. El paseo por el parque transmite mucha paz. La entrada al museo, para mi gusto no es imprescindible",Tripadvisor
"A big park that has museums, memorials and a shrine. The most iconic building the A Dome is just on the right hand side after you enter the park. There is also a museum just past the entrance where there are a few displays and in the basement it tells a story of 1 man surviving the blast and how he escaped the building. There is also the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Musuem which has a lot of stories, photos. There is usually a waiting time of approx 45 - 60 minutes to get into the museum",Tripadvisor
Peace Memorial Park houses many monuments and the museum and Memorial Hall. Make sure to set aside enough time so that you can slowly walk through the park and reflect.,Tripadvisor
"Worth the time to wander through the well kept park. Statues and enormous empty spaces for contemplation. A memorial to the first atomic bomb and those lives lost.

When I last visited, the Children's Peace monument was enrobed in paper cranes. It was beautiful",Tripadvisor
"Fui para año nuevo y hachiko tenia a otro mini hachiko a su lado para celebrar el año nuevo.
Siempre suele haver un poco de cola para hacerse la foto con la estatua, pero avanza deprisa y la gente es muy ordenada.",Tripadvisor
"Despite the tragic reason for this park, the city has turned it into a park where there are many monuments with good information, plenty of trees and a very pleasant place to visit.

There are a lot of people visiting, we were there in the busy summer, however because the park is well set out, it did not feel busy and we had plenty of time to read, take photos and search for the next monument.

Well work a visit. If you have 2-3 hours you can explore yourself.",Tripadvisor
"I love the story of Hachiko and whenever I am in Tokyo I love to go and revisit the statue. So moving, but his memory lives on.",Tripadvisor

"Nada más salir de la estación de Shibuya nos encontramos con esta pequeña plaza donde el centro de las miradas es la famosa estatua de Hachiko.
Suele haber gente sentada y en nuestro caso cola para hacernos la foto, pero merece la pena.
Sobretodo si conocéis la historia que hay detrás, y en el caso de que no, antes de hacerle la visita podéis ver la película, o leer un poco y seguro que lo añadiréis en vuestra ruta.",Tripadvisor

Profesor je jednog dana umro na fakultetu i vise se nikada nije vratio kuci, a Haciko ga je cekao svakodnevno narednih 9 godina dok nije uginuo. Spomenik je napravljen 1934. godine.",Tripadvisor

"Es conmovedora su historia, se encuentra a menos de 20 maestros del cruce de Shibuya.
La estatua es a tamaño real. Conmovedora y verdadera!

Recomendable ya que estás al lado!!!",Tripadvisor
"A really well maintained statue, I really recommend to get informed about the story of Hachiko before visiting. The place itself felt really calm and there was like an atmosphere of respect toward this fantastic dog. Apart from the statue itself, all the area is really well maintained, everything is super clean even if it’s situated in the center of a big district like Shibuya, it’s beautiful, I love it to the point that I went the first time in the morning and then I came back a second time to visit it also during the evening.
I loved this place so much, can’t wait to see it again next time I’ll be in Tokyo!",Tripadvisor
"Se avete visto il film, siete amanti degli animali, dei cani e la storia vi ha commosso non potrà non emozionarvi guardare che la statua è reale e si trova proprio lì, all’uscita della stazione! Perché non fermarsi anche solo un minuto?!",Tripadvisor
"Immancabile un saluto al grande Hachiko, amico fedele dell'uomo. Un fiume di gente a rendergli omaggio. La sua storia ha colpito tutti... La piazza intitolata ad Hachiko si trova appena fuori dalla stazione di shibuya (uscita 8).Chiedo ad ognuno di voi di passare per fargli un saluto. Apprezzerà dall'alto.",Tripadvisor
C’est une statue du chien qui est devenu célèbre suite au tournage d’un film. Elle est à l’intersection de Shibuya Crossing. Beaucoup de personnes voulaient prendre des photos,Tripadvisor
"Statue du célèbre chien qui attendait son maître tous les jours à la gare. Un jour son maître n'est pas rentré et Hachiko l'a attendu pendant plus de dix ans. Une histoire émouvante qui attire énormément de monde autour de sa statue pour prendre une photo. A vous de voir si cela vous intéresse ou non, certains voudront absolument la voir et d'autres n'y trouveront aucun intérêt.",Tripadvisor
"Difficile à trouver au milieu du parvis de la gare principale de Tokyo, il faut suivre le flot de touristes pour découvrir cette statue sous un arbre.
Et patienter avant de pouvoir la photographier.",Tripadvisor
Tellement émouvante et belle que cette histoire de Hachiko. L’histoire de la fidélité de ce chien envers son maître est absolument bouleversante. Cette statue en est le symbole incontournable de Tokyo.,Tripadvisor
渋谷駅前にある銅像。JRハチ公口を出るとすぐにある。ハチ公像は待ち合わせスポットとなっており、像の周りには多くの人が座っていたり、人を待っていたりする。ハチ公は西郷隆盛の忠犬として有名で、その勇姿を称している。,Tripadvisor
Bello il ricordo della fedeltà di un cane che è stato adottato dalla popolazione del quartiere. Interessante il confronto con un incrocio affollato vicino alla stazione. Il suggerimento di una pausa di riflessione nella frenesia? Mi piace pensarla così,Tripadvisor
"On connaît si bien l'histoire derrière cette statue qu'elle devient légende, et précède l'expérience de visite. Bien avant l'arrivée dans la capitale du Japon, on sait le symbole de fidélité qui a suscité l'émotion. Tout ceci ébranle bien sûr le visiteur, mais hélas la statue ici placée est désormais partie d'un cirque. Celui des selfies, des luttes pour sa photographie avec l'impérial canin, accentué par un environnement de bâches (tout est en travaux dans le quartier). Mouais.",Tripadvisor
"La meta, si no te es relevante no pierdas tu tiempo. Yo fui porque ya estaba en Shibuya Crossing, y solo me asomé, hay una fila larga para tomarse la foto con el perro. Está todo desgastado y no está bonito. Hay basura y mucha gente. Mejor tomate una selfie desde un lado y no pierdas tiempo, la neta no es la gran cosa.",Tripadvisor
"Este lugar debes visitar si estás en Tokio, es un pequeño lugar pero con mucha historia y tradición. Aunque hay que hacer fila para las fotos, estas salen excelentes!!",Tripadvisor
"Suggestiva la statua se si pensa alla storia vera.
Purtroppo c'è sempre coda per effettuare le foto che devono essere fatte veloce con la gente che pressa",Tripadvisor
"Tiene su historia detras, que evidentemente es emotiva. Y será icónica para mucha gente. Pero, salvo que pertenezcas a ese grupo, no deja de ser una pequeña estatua en una zona que si no es por la cola de gente para hacerse foto, ni te das cuenta que está ahí",Tripadvisor
"Davvero emozionante , piccola fila ( forse per la giornata piovosa ) , ma ne vale la pena .Si trova proprio all uscita della stagione metro di Shibuya ( è indicata gia l uscita specifica prima che si esca dalla metro stessa )",Tripadvisor

Se puede llegar hasta aquí en metro, bus, taxi, o caminando.",Tripadvisor
いまさら、と思いますが写真を撮りました。雨が降っていても傘をさして待合せている人たちがいます。一時期、都市計画などでハチ公の向きがいろいろ変わったりしましたが、いまのところでやっと落ち着いたようです。,Tripadvisor
"If you know the story of hachiko, this is the statue. A lot of people were taking photo there. This statue located exactly in hachiko exit of shibuya station.
I think (I'm not really sure), I found similar statue near tower record shibuya bus less crowded.",Tripadvisor

"A lovely statue honouring Hachikō, a Very Good Boy.

Hachikō Square is a very popular meeting point and is often crowded with tourists and locals but there are quiet times of day as well. I visited several times during a recent trip to Tokyo and had no trouble taking photos (and having my photo taken next to the Hachikō statue). Don't miss the large, colourful ceramic relief mural “Hachiko Family” also located in Hachikō Square.",Tripadvisor
"Отличное место, вызывает положительные эмоции как в кино))) Очень много народа, но при этом можно быстро сфотографироваться)",Tripadvisor
Se siete a Shibuya fermatevi un attimo a vedere la statua di Hachiko proprio vicino alla stazione e all'incrocio. Hachiko era il cane di un professore e ogni pomeriggio andava ad attendere il suo ritorno alla stazione. Il professore un giorno morì ma Hachiko continuò per 10 anni ad andare ad aspettarlo alla stazione.,Tripadvisor
"Worth visiting, if you know the story. It's often quite crowded and people are taking turns (or not so much at times) to get a picture with the statue. Don't go out of your way to see it, but pass by if you are near.",Tripadvisor
"eine sehr beeindruckende Story und ein toller Film (wenn auch von den Amis), ein Platz zum Verweilen und über Freundschaft und Zuneigung nachdenken, über Treue oder Loyalität, in diesem Falle scheint es aber eine höhere Form von Liebe wenn auch zwischen Hund und Herrchen ... meine Empfehlung unbedingt den Film ansehen mit Richard Gere",Tripadvisor
"Die Statue in Bronze geht auf dem vielbelaufenden Bahnhofsvorplatz direkt an der Shibuya Crossing unter. Im Nachhinein habe ich den Film Hachiko mit R. G. gesehen und fand plötzlich mehr Emotionen daran.
",Tripadvisor
"Sehr rührende Geschichte, die das Monument von Hachiko erzählt. Ich finde es sehr schön, dass in Japan eine solche Geschichte geschätzt wird! Die Treue eines Hundes zu seinem Herrchen ist etwas ganz wundervolles ❤️",Tripadvisor
Nice to visit this good boy after hearing his story 🙂 everything this statue represents is heart warming,Tripadvisor
"Возможно, история Хатико (Hachiko) и не дошла бы до наших дней, если бы не писатель Хирокичи Сайто. Именно он в далеком 1932 году написал в газету «Асахи Симбун» статью о собаке из Сибуя, ожидающей возвращения своего хозяина, умершего семь лет назад. Эта история покорила сердца японцев, образ пса стал примером беззаветной любви и преданности.
В 1934 году в честь Хатико на пожертвования горожан на станции Сибуя (Токио) была установлена бронзовая статуя. Надпись на нем гласит: «Хатико, верный пес». В торжественной церемонии почетным гостем была сама Хатико...
Сегодня памятник Хатико -- одна из самых известных достопримечательностей не только Токио, но и всей Японии. Маленький скверик, где стоит статуя, всегда полон разноязыким гомоном туристов со всего света.
Ежегодно, 8 апреля в Токио проходит день поминовения Хатико.
В разных префектурах страны поставили несколько памятников Хатико и его хозяину -- доктору Уэно.",Tripadvisor

"Di per sè la statua dice poco, a parte essere uno dei punti di ritrovo preferiti dai giovani a Shibuya, ma la storia che questa statua si porta dietro rende obbligatoria una fermata e uno foto ricordo, magari dopo aver visto il film con Richard Gere per apprezzarne al meglio il valore intrinseco.",Tripadvisor

I love your emphasis on good eating - its the best thing about travel and the shots of you and your brother clearly enjoying your food made my mouth water. I really enjoyed your editing and background music which came across as highly professional - If you don't currently do this for a living perhaps you should get a sponsor! Looking forward to watching the individual videos for the cities you have visited.",YouTube

"I am Japanese.
The suicide rate in Japan is not so high.
Many people misunderstand this because the Western mass media reports that the suicide rate in Japan is very high, which is not true.
You can find youtube videos of suicide rates around the world by searching this title. →Top 20 Country by Suicide Rate (1950-2018)
The source for the ""Top 20 Countries by Suicide Rate (1950-2018)"" is ""World Health Organization & World Bank (WHO)"".
If anyone looks into the data of ""WHO"", they can see the fact that the suicide rate in Japan is not high.
Here are some countries with higher suicide rates among young people than Japan.
↓　　　↓　　　↓
Crude suicide rates(per 100 000 population)　2019年　WHO
Japan 15-29 years old 13.54 people
USA 15-29 years old 17.72 people
Sweden 15-29 years old 14.57 people
Finland 15-29 years old 18.47 people
Iceland 15-29 years old 14.6 people
New Zealand 15 to 29 years old 13.92 people
Russia 15 to 29 years old 19.38 people
Australia 15-19 years old 10.22 people
Japan 15-19 years old 7.84 people
By the way, it's a pity that the music used in the video is Chinese music.
Overall, except for some misunderstandings, I think you have made a favorable video about Japan.",YouTube
"Anton, your insights about Japan  are spot on. Your cinematography is topnotch. I was in Tokyo as a foreign exchange student and thoroughly loved my experience. Hope you upload more videos and visit my country the Philippines 🇵🇭",YouTube
Lived in Tokyo for five years from 2003-2007. Best and most interesting five years of my life.,YouTube
"Japan is my favourite country. I can meet the locals hospitality, culture, food, nature, best integrated transportation. Japan has everything.",YouTube
"Have seen so many of your other videos and was excited to see you uploaded Japan, as that's where I live. It's easy to feel indifferent about Tokyo after living here for 14 years, but your cinematography reminded me how much there is to appreciate. I do hope you get to come back soon. when you do, don't hesitate to let us know if you need anything! Much love to you and everyone in Ukraine. Think of you all every day. <3",YouTube
Jobs will pay your bills business will make you rich but investment makes and you keep you wealthy the future is inevitable,YouTube
"Anton, your cinematography and narration along with the natural joy on your face make your videos an absolute delight! Thank you!
I had the good fortune of visiting Japan in 1998 for a university friend’s wedding. I agree that it was a « wonderland ! »",YouTube

"Thank you so much, Anton! You are my favorite travel channel-- you make it come to life. ",YouTube
"As a Japanese, I don't want to be misunderstood in many ways, so I will explain. Japanese people are not workaholics.
There are a few cases of death by overwork, but this is not a common occurrence.
That information about Japan's working hours is wrong.
Some Western media are exaggerating and half lying about Japan.We Japanese do not work 70+ hours a week.
The average daily working hours for a Japanese person is about 9 hours.
Japanese work shorter hours than in Canada, the United States and Italy,　Australia.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　↓
【Employment　-　Hours worked　‐　OECD　Data　Hours】 （Worked: Average annual hours actually worked）
In Japan, the law allows up to 45 hours of overtime per month.
In Japan, if a worker needs to work more than 45 hours of overtime in a month, he or she must apply to the Labor Standards Inspection Office for permission to do so.
Few Japanese work 70 hours a week.
※The total number of annual holidays in Japanese company is about　76days~124days.
Overall, except for some misunderstandings, I think you have made a favorable video about Japan.",YouTube
You make great videos. You are an inspiration to all travelers.,YouTube

Good luck with your channel.",YouTube

In contrast to many attention seeking videos, your video had a quiet & relaxing vibe, which fit's perfectly to Japan. Thanks especially for all the food recommendations! If you travel Japan, you gotta love trying new food ",YouTube

I just bump into this video and thank you for covering such OUTSTANDING places in Japan.  i love Japan but some of the places i didn’t know. Someday i want to visit japan but here i have a question.....can you please tell me which season is best in japan if i want to go there for short time like a month or so???? ,YouTube
"These recommendations are AMAZING!!! As someone who has lived in Japan for a long time, just thinking of researching transportation and translating is overwhelming lol
I'm surprised you didn't include Tohoku. Highly recommend Towada-ko and Oirase-Keiryu if you haven't been there! Also all the small islands like Tsushima and Hachijo-jima",YouTube
Awesome thanks x,YouTube
Going to do a little of the Kumano Kodo this year and I CAN'T WAIT to see the Nachi Falls.,YouTube

"4:34 Wowww, what season do I have to go to see the waterfall running in reverse?
Ah, I bet I'll need to buy the ebook for that, huh.
(In all seriousness, the guide looks enticing and splendidly well composed. Which is no surprise at all when it's coming from you!)",YouTube
"Congrats on the net book (I don’t know the right word for digital books. Infact, it’s probably that).  You really are a credit to Japan, I hope they notice that.  I’ll fire in to the book on payday haha. Keep on the awesome work you do",YouTube
I used to live in Beppu. Yeah. It's great.,YouTube
Very enjoyable.,YouTube
"I just bought this guide and WOW!!!! This is EXACTLY what I was looking for. This is absolutely amazing. Thank you for putting this together. I am headed to japan for 2 weeks in april and I'm already going to Tokyo, Kyoto, and probably Kanazawa. But I had a couple extra days I needed to fill and I wasn't sure where to go. So this guide has been a life saver.

Thank you for putting it together. And I encourage anyone thinking of going to japan to buy it!",YouTube
"If you ever visit Kyoto, there is a kawadoko restaurant (Ryori Ryokan) Hirobun just north of the city you can take a train and bus/taxi too that makes for a fun side trip to eat somen straight out of the flowing water. 日本が とても大好きだ!!",YouTube

"Wow, these are some really amazing hidden gems in Japan! I love discovering new and unique places to visit, and this video has definitely given me some great ideas for my next trip. It's always great to see lesser-known spots that offer a different perspective of a country's culture and history.",YouTube
Bought your guide! This video and the guide have helped SO MUCH in planning me and my friend's trip. I leave Sunday! Im really looking forward to it!!!! THANK YOU!,YouTube
We love Hokkaido in both summer and winter!  We haven’t been to the igloos yet. Next time we want to make it to the snow festival. ️ Heidi,YouTube
very nice!!!!  New spot to visit!,YouTube
"I love Hakone so much, you can see Mount Fuji, experience onsen from the mountain or even coffee onsen! a very interesting Hydrangea train, go down the big lake with big Torii Gate, and go up to the sulphuric Owakudani mountain which apparently sells black egg that believed can make you stay on earth for 7 years longer  plus there’s Hakone open air museum.. haven’t been to Nikko, but i think Hakone is hard to beat tho! ",YouTube
Thank you so much for this!! ,YouTube
"Love this! I have been to a few of the places on your list - Nikko a few times. Shirakawago was magical, it snowed a bit when I was there. I also recommend nearby Hida Takayama. Beppu was so lovely, and I loved visiting the art galleries in nearby Oita City, too. Ouchi-juku was beautiful in the autumn. I had such a nice day there. I loved the whole Aizu area of Fukushima, and stayed in an amazing vegan-friendly guest house in an old school, called Dana Village in Nishi-Aizu. So so recommended. I lived in Japan for a few years and this year am going back for the first time since leaving. I have visited every prefecture, but Nachi Falls is still high on my list! Maybe this time. Just to echo your tip to rent a car - please do! I loved driving in Japan. It was so easy, as I'm from the UK, so used to driving onthe left, all the cars are automatic and the roads are really good. You see sooo much beauty. Aso San was one of the most beautiful drives I've ever done. I really loved it there. Also, you get to stop at roadside service stations and pick up lovely local souvenirs and local produce. Can't wait to come back, you have really inspired me ️",YouTube
Great selection of spots in Japan.,YouTube
Thank you for this awesome information. Definitely will include those hidden gems on our next trip. Do they allow guests with tattoo to use the onsens? Added this video to my library and will purchase the e-book.,YouTube
I will get this guide… I can’t wait,YouTube
I've been to Nikko and enjoyed it there. Stayed in the wrong location perhaps not much around but was still very beautiful,YouTube
"No thank you hannah because you have given me exactly what i was looking for in going to tokyo japan when it comes to country side of things of course ill be adding more over the years with my hubby and future child in ten years time wholl be 8 years old. 
Cannot wait for the dream of a trip. ",YouTube
Thank you!!!!!! !!!!,YouTube
"Was that Blenderguru?? Also beatuifully helpful video Hannah, will definitely be back when planning a Japan trip!",YouTube
"I'm happy to see that you included the Kurashiki Bikan district, it's my favourite city destination in Japan. I always recommend it to visitors to Japan, especially those who want somewhere other than as you refer it 'the golden triangle' of tourist sites to visit.",YouTube
"Do you reccommend getting the Japanese Braininflammation ( Encephalitis )-vaccine? 
I'm going with a buddy of mine for a 2-week vacation :D thanks for the video!",YouTube
"Tsubame onsen is free, at least it was when I was there early last year. There were a few warning signs about bears though. Always wonder about that - I heard that a guy was even attacked a few years ago by a bear at the rotenburo at Takaragawa (another onsen I've stayed at in Minakami). Mind you, they do have bears in cages there, so I guess this was one getting their own back",YouTube
This is great timing! We are going back to Japan (from New Zealand) in September and I really want to see and do things we didn’t get a chance to see and do last time. I know there are sooo many lists online but if you had to pick your top 3 in Tokyo Osaka and Kyoto what would they be? Trying to put a basic itinerary together for a group of us who are going for a couple of weeks. After seeing this video I am definitely going to be advocating for trying a few different places that aren’t the usual go to for every tourist,YouTube
I wish I had you guide in 2016 when I went to Japan. I'm going again this summer but I am going on a 6 weeks camper trip from Tokyo to Hokkaido and back. Hopefully to find soms best kept secrets in those prefectures.,YouTube
"Thank you for the interesting video, and congratulations on finishing the guide.",YouTube
"Tadao Ando, yes, sensei (I think you've been to the Benesse House Museum, prob my #1)  Discerning girl   ",YouTube
Wth a wild blender guru appeared ,YouTube

"Even as Japanese, I've only been to 1 place (Chapel on the water) among your list of places.

Thank you for the information, Hannah chan",YouTube
"Thanks so much for this Hannah, very cool and hope to make use of it for our trip in July!  

I was wondering if you included any information about how to rent a car in Japan, in advance (online) before a trip from Australia?  I am having so much trouble finding a reliable way to book a hire car.  Our whole trip is regional based mostly and we really need a car to make it work.  

Any suggestions, gratefully received, thanks in advance!",YouTube
Its here! Can't wait to discover new places. ,YouTube
It would be nice if I could go there too,YouTube
"Surprised you didn’t include Okutama, Tokyo’s hidden nature area that doesn’t get enough love.",YouTube

La guia esta solo disponible en español?,YouTube
I love you,YouTube
I’m on it exactly whatever was in this video.  I am familiar with japan but don’t plan/ do the from there to there parts. Wish I had a real guide but this will work. I hope. No I will not do a car. Solo traveler.,YouTube
My sister and I liked this video! Japan is a wonderful place!,YouTube
"I was in Japan in 2019. I was amazed how easy it was to get around Tokyo without knowing an japanese. (we had a japanese friend for the first part of the week when we went to the country for a day). I was a vegetarian back then. Actually I was a vegetarian for 30 years. I now eat just about anything that comes out of the ocean (except shrimp. yuck). and will try anything else. I eat bugs, eel, fish skn, etc. But I now want to go back to Japan to see J-Rock shows, ride motorcycles in the country, and eat sushi. Any thoughts on riding motorcyles through Japan?",YouTube
"Wow that travel Guide sounds amazing!
I have a question regarding traveling with small children:
Which island would you choose: 
Ishigaki, Amami or Okinawa? Thank you so much in advance!",YouTube
"3:26 Doughnut man himself, blender guru spotted !",YouTube
" 5,00 USD
Dope!",YouTube
Thank you so much for this amazing Video!!!!!!!! Two questions: is it easy to ride the car in Japan would you recomend? And would it be too much stress to do such a Trip with two small kids? (6 and 3 years?) :),YouTube
"Tip for those of you who seek out a more peaceful and relaxed atmosphere but still want to see the ""popular"" spots. For those popular sites that are open at night- go then. Some examples:

Asakusa- night time is much more quiet, especially if you go when the stalls are mostly closed...as a bonus some of the food stalls will offer discounts.

Fushimi Inari- Grounds are open 24/7 I believe so if you go at night and bring a flashlight it makes for a great walk with almost nobody around. 

Kaiyukan- Also open at night, it of course does close but it's way less crowded at night. 

Of course some of the experience with going to some of these places is experiencing the temple itself which will probably be closed, this is especially so if you wanted to get something from the temple such as a Goshuin in your book. But I try to visit in the afternoon so i can still get these items AND experience some tranquility.",YouTube
local guide at huviplus in  Nikko was awesome!,YouTube
hannahさんの画像はいつもきれいですね！,YouTube
Well done girl ,YouTube
"We are planning a big trip in January, does your book convey things to do and places to go in winter?",YouTube
I am going to travel to Japan for 3 weeks next year and planning it stresses me A LOT. I will travel in spring and my only concern is the massive crowds. I would love to buy your Tour Guide but I would like to know something: Are there also spots while you travelled during Covid and that’s why there weren’t many tourists?,YouTube
"Hi, are some of these accessible by JR trains? I’m doing a trip but only traveling thru JR train since i’m buying the 14 day pass.",YouTube
Is there a good time of year to avoid other tourist from popular locations? I know not to attend during Golden Week,YouTube
"Hello Hannah! I’ve loved your videos and enjoyed your cute personality! I’m considering to buy your guide but not sure will it be helpful for my trip to Japan on 1-9th on June 2023.

I have a question that is not related with the video, but hope that someone can help me.

"The only way the Japanese have remained such a unique culture is that they vehemently resist assimilation. Working in Japan temporarily is an edifying experience, but long term stays are disappointing due to the difficulty of making friends. It gets very lonely. Nevertheless, they are a fascinating people and it's a pleasure to learn about them. Thanks for the video.",YouTube

Your are probably the very best travel video documenter ever. I followed Ian wright from Lonely Planet back in the day. I bought my first 3ccd mini dv camera in Akihabara in 2000 I still have the original camera and the first footage I shot with it. I wish I could have stayed in that industry but life changes paths. 
My favs are:
Anton Somewhere 
Chris Broad of abroad in Japan
Bald and bankrupt 
Seek Discomfort (yes theory)
Sunny  from Best ever food review show.
Early food ranger
Fd world’s most dangerous roads
Departures
And obviously all Anthony Bourdain travel series!
All the best and keep up the awesome work and your video on Canada and Toronto was spot on!
That is where I am from. Every time I see your videos I always want to move away to one of the locations where you did your review on",YouTube

Japan is rich in tourism resources, and Japanese people frequently travel within the country.
Each region has its own specialties and offers delicious meals and souvenirs that make the most of these specialties.
As a volcanic country, Japan has hot springs all over the country, and bathing in hot springs while enjoying nature is a regular trip for Japanese people.",YouTube

Bro I hate travel guides, but yours was so thorough and enjoyable that I can’t help to give thanks through a little bit of money. You deserve at least a bowl of ramen (hopefully you don’t live in CA because inflation sucks and this is barely enough). 

My girlfriend and I are going this January and this helped me so much with the planning/prep. It makes such a difference having a good, thorough but concise, and enjoyable guide. Thank you so much for the video and your help!",YouTube
"Hi, Allan! I've been researching Japan for a week or so and this is by far the best video/vlog/documentary I found.

"I travelled Japan in September 2019. I had the best time, lots of incredible sights, delicious food and amazing people. I went to many of the places you did, but couldn't help thinking that leaving Hiroshima out was wrong. It's a wonderful city and is such an important location in world history.  The museum and peace part are so moving. And while in the city a visit to Miyolima Island is gorgeous.  In saying that, loved the video.",YouTube

The best 14-day travel vlog to Japan. More about experiences and not just about sightseeing. Thank you,YouTube

"I have been to Japan many times but you still managed to put a few places on my list of new spots to visit on future trips. Some places I would recommend that are not on your video are Magome/Tsumago Nakasendo Trek (a 3 hour hike between these two towns on the famous trek), Nachi Falls (Japan's highest waterfall in Wakayama Prefecture), Yamadera (mountainous temple town), Onomichi (seaside town) and Hokkaido which is now accessible via Shinkansen, though probably easier to take a budget flight to Sapporo. If you're looking for day trips from Tokyo probably two of the more popular ones are Kamakura (Little Kyoto) & Nikko (mountainous temple/onsen town). Kamakura can be combined with Enoshima & Yokohama.",YouTube
When I go to my honeymoon I am following this guide!!! Thank you!! Such an amazing and beautiful video  can’t wait to see Japan!!!!,YouTube

"I-ra-ssha-i-ma-se is used from store personnel to greet customers as they come in only. You don't need to reply back. Smile is ok. Before 10am, you would say o-ha-you go-za-i-ma-su (good morning).

Wow! Thank you!! Just thank you so much for giving first timers to Japan so much very practical information!!!

"Travel tip from someone with food allergies. There are Japanese allergy cards you can find online and print out. At the restaurants, go to a worker or get the attention of a worker and ask ""yonde kudasai"" (please read), and hand your allergy card over. Point to the menu item u want and ask ""ok?."" This worked really well for me. They would tell u which items contain things ur allergic to, or let u know its ok (either in japanese woth gestures, rough english, or using google translate).",YouTube
Careful though with the Japan Rail Pass; it had a 70% price increase in October of 2023 and in the majority of cases it is now way more convenient money wise to simply buy individual train tickets for your trip,YouTube
"Loved how you are so culturally sensitive and not acting like you can't be bothered with the local customs and norms. You didn't just learn some local important phrases in a curt fashion but also the most respectful way to use them. It's those little things that create the most intimate connection with the locals...anywhere we travle in the world. Love your video and will follow you more!
Excited for our first trip to Japan in July. Arigatou Gozaimas!",YouTube
"This is hands down one of the best, most informative videos I have found on travel to Japan!! You focused not on just sights to see (which thousands of bloggers already do) but so so much more useful and resourceful info!! Thank you!",YouTube
Thanks for the info share! Looks like you guys really maximized your time there!,YouTube
Thank you for all of the great tips. I really enjoyed watching your video. It was very informative and helpful.,YouTube

"I was trying to decide whether to go back to Japan in the spring or autumn (as last time I went in winter) and was very tempted by cherry blossom season in spring but my gosh the autumnal foliage is absolutely gorgeous. I'm in awe  This was so beautifully filmed and especially like the extra suggestions you gave in each place for extra days. 
I'm so glad you and your partner had a great time!",YouTube
Japan calms my soul on another level,YouTube

This is the best Japan travel video I have seen. You did a marvelous job showing the country!,YouTube
"Your camera work was incredibly amazing! You obviously didn't even use a drone yet you were also able to capture the scenery in the best ways possible. My jaw dropped when the screen switched to Hida Folk Village scene. Your minimal edits to the colors delivered the realest atmosphere and I definitely felt like I was there traveling throughout the entire video, the mountain scene at the onsen was my fav part. Also your voiceover was very clean and professional. Hope to see more Japan's videos from you in the future!",YouTube

Also currently been learning Japanese for a few months",YouTube

One of my favorite youtube videos in general now, hoping you had the best time and if you ever travel there again, have a great trip again.

This has motivated me to take my family there once I get a stable income, as the Japanese culture is fascinating to me and I’ve been a fan of the country since a small age. 
Thank you for this video, Allan",YouTube
"I absolutely loved going on holiday to Japan. The most beautiful place I've ever been to. Went to Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka and Hiroshima, saw so many amazing places in each area. I definitely want to go again one day and explore even more parts I haven't been to yet. Amazing video explaining it all. Thank you!",YouTube

This is an updated itinerary based on this video and my trips to Japan. The itinerary will cover day-to-day activities, transportation between cities, hotels, restaurants, and a travel budget. I've also included a ""Custom Google Maps"" for Japan with saved pins and locations that follows the itinerary.",YouTube
"I am a Japanese living in Osaka. What I want foreigners who come to Japan to experience is late-night rental cycling in Tokyo. It's strange for a Japanese person like me to say this, but Japan is safe.  I think that's why tourism is possible. I used to do late-night cycling in Tokyo, and it was an unforgettable memory.  I'd like everyone to taste it too!   
I used a translation app, so I think it's a little strange English, so please forgive me. We are waiting for the day when you can come to Japan!",YouTube
This is the most high quality Japan vlog I have ever seen.,YouTube
" 10,00 USD
This is probably the most beautiful YouTube video I've ever watched.  You have real talent when it comes to filming, audio, and editing. My boyfriend and I are off to Japan this coming spring and your video was incredibly helpful and inspiring!",YouTube
"I am a Japanese living in Okinawa.

There are 47 prefectures in Japan, and I think that each of the 47 prefectures has 47 different charms. That's why I love this country. In addition to sushi, ramen, and sukiyaki, each prefecture has its own traditional cuisine, traditional culture, and wonderful scenery.

For example, in Okinawa, where I was born and raised, there are many other unique Okinawan dishes such as Okinawa soba, goya chanpuru, pawpaw, and sata andagi. Also, since Okinawa was originally a single country called the Ryukyu Kingdom, it has its own culture and history. Karate is also a sport that originated in Okinawa. In terms of music, Sanshin, Eisa, and Kachaashi are famous. As you can see, Japan has more than just one attraction. I would like you to travel to Japan and find your favorite prefecture.

I translated it so there may be some wrong English",YouTube
How many ppl besides me sees Japan as my dream place to visit?? Its one place I MUST go to before I die,YouTube
"You have no idea how badly I want to visit Japan. It’s a feeling in my gut that is ever persistent. I can’t explain it.

UPDATE: Started saving for a trip with my sister, for next spring (if the boarders open up) so the dream is coming true!",YouTube
"Japan has done brilliantly in preserving its history, culture and heritage. I am definitely visiting soon.",YouTube
Probably one of the most detailed and amazing vlogs I've seen featuring Japan. I'm so astounded by Japan's culture so beautiful.,YouTube
"I am Japanese, but you seem to be enjoying ""Japan"" more than most Japanese.

By the way, to those who are planning to visit Japan after watching this video.
I recommend you to come in autumn, winter, or spring, because summer in Japan is very hot.
(Sorry for my poor English)",YouTube
"ありがとうございます！ Thank You for showing Japan! I love your camera, beautiful shots you made!",YouTube
"I've been planning a trip to Japan throughout the duration of the pandemic and every month or so I come back to this video to meticulously lay out my trip. This is honestly the best resource on all of YouTube for an in-depth look at what Japan is like, and the HD captures with the ambient music/simple voiceover makes this such a serene watch. Keep up this amazing work, Allan!",YouTube
"For someone who cant ever travel because of health complications, you sir have given me the closest and most beautifully navigated video of actually being in Japan.I am so grateful",YouTube
"This is not just a vlog. It is a documentary! You just earned a sub, Allan!",YouTube
"Thank you for your wonderfully edited and narrated videos - your suggestions about Kyoto are great for first-timers and for seasoned Japanophiles. I particularly like your tone and your presence in these videos - tone is calm and respectful, presence is not ""all about me and a little Japan too"" but just right. Domo arigato gozaimasu!",YouTube

Just arrived from Iceland and Norway and Japan has been on my list for a long time,. Have not decided yet between a cruise vacation or one just like you did.  I thank you",YouTube
"I think in my Japan adventure I really want to do it the other way around: See the hustle of the cities at first then go and relax in the mountains and nature to decompress.

*Thanks for all the likes, I will be heading to Japan Aug 2023, my father passed away in Oct '22 and this video has given me inspiration for places to scatter some of his ashes.

",YouTube
"I was originally going to do Tokyo -> Kyoto -> Osaka next March, but this really changed my mind.",YouTube
"For anyone reading this. I went to Japan last June. Before going, I watched this video probably 7 times. I couldn’t have been more excited. Allan does a legitimate perfect job of describing how Japan feels and what you should be doing there. The trip changed my life. Follow his advice. I get emotional watching this video now. Thank you, Allan",YouTube
"I love your packing method, and I'm happy to say that I am very close to your method.  I used to travel for corporate America years ago so I had made mistakes in those many years. But now we travel for fun to see the country so it's a different style of packing. I feel good that I'm on the right track. I recently purchased a set of your packing cubes, and they totally surprised me! 
Now, tips on packing for Pepper, we don't travel abroad right now but for me packing for toy Poodle, Jolie Fleur,  has been a challenge,  I don't know how you do it for international travel for Pepper. Video, please!",YouTube
By far the best guide we’ve had the pleasure of watching! We will be using this for our first trip! Thank you!,YouTube

I’ve been to Japan many years ago ( in Kumamoto and Osaka) and I absolutely love it. The people are so polite and respectful! Their food was simply outstanding, so healthy and I low fat.
I truly wish to visit Japan soon .
Thank you once again and please stay safe !",YouTube
"Thank you for your amazing and absolutely not trivial tips. We are just back from our amazing trip in Japan that we organized mostly following your video. Thank you, thank you, thank you from Italy!",YouTube
"Thank you Allan for this amazing video, we pretty much followed your route after watching the Iceland video and visited last June. I came across this video whilst staying in Kyoto a few days ago, I started to watch and recognized your calm voice from the Iceland video and so watched this through. (I also subscribed of course). Our next destination was Osaka, but after watching your video, we decided to go to Koyasan first. I had never heard of the place and would definitely have missed it. We went yesterday - 19th February 2023, it was was raining hard, misty and fairly cold (snow on the ground). We started with the Danjō-garan temple complex and had the place completely to ourselves, the rain and mist added to the experience and was one of the best days of my life. We have travelled to over 40 countries including many over the past 9 months and Koyasan for me rates right up there with the best places in the world. We also spent a fair while at the Cemetery which was also an amazing experience that we will not forget. Thank you so much for letting us know about this place and for making such awesome videos. We will definitely check where Allan went before finalizing out itinerary in future!",YouTube
I felt every bit of the places you visited and the peace can be felt throughout the video...Inspired me to visit Japan!! Amazing work!,YouTube

The footage and editing is also next level too :)",YouTube
"This whole film, editing, music, presentation in general is close to perfection.",YouTube
"It seems like tourists often buy food at convenience stores these days, but we don't recommend doing so.

It's better to go to restaurants because you can find much more delicious food at the same price or a little higher.

For the same reason, we also do not recommend cheap conveyor belt sushi that is brought to you by trains like those at amusement facilities.",YouTube
"Thank you for this. So many of these videos are like, go see this super touristy thing! Also really appreciate how this was shot, looks great.",YouTube
"Japan has a lot of beautiful and exciting places to visit, maybe a month travelling wasn't enough. But this is the best backpacking itinerary for 14 days, great job! I miss Japan so much :(",YouTube

"This video makes me nostalgic it reminds me of the trip I had to Japan back in 2018, and sadly with covid nobody can go anywhere, so it feels kind of good to see all of those places I've been to and all the other places I want to go to. I hope that in the near future it will be possible to travel again.",YouTube

"What a beautiful documentary of your trip! Watching this really made me reminisce my honeymoon back in Dec 2019 on my first trip to Japan. We had 11 days to travel and we went to Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, and Nara. It was tiring traveling to all of them in a short amount of time, but I loved it! The culture, the people, the food- I loved every minute of my stay in Japan. I can’t wait to come back with my husband. ",YouTube

Beautiful informational video,YouTube
I really like how you don’t super hype everything.  So many Utubers make their videos about how cool they are and how super incredibly awesome a place is when it’s just a normal trip.,YouTube
Thanks to you i was able to organise trip with my friends from Czech republic to Japan and we saw a lot of places that you visited in the video. it was awesome and thank you i would remember it for the rest of my life. ,YouTube
40mins of pure bliss watching my favourite country. Thank you,YouTube
This is more than a Vlog. I feel like watching a documentary . After seeing this video my desire to visit and experience the very rich culture of Japan grew stronger. Life is too short and I will go to Japan. Hope this pandemic ends already. New subscriber here.,YouTube
Thank you for introducing Japan to everyone. I live in Kyoto and some foreign tourists behave annoyingly in Kyoto. I sincerely hope that kind-hearted people like you will visit the city for sightseeing and have a wonderful experience.,YouTube
I am heading to Japan for 14 days in a few days from Bangkok. Your video was just perfect for someone who has never travelled to Japan. A huge thank you so much for all the detailed itinerary. A very special Kia Ora from New Zealand.,YouTube
I moved to Japan 4 years ago with my mother it took us time to adjust and we even thought of leaving but we stayed and I’m glad we did because a year later we went to koyasan and it was amazing to see in person one of the most beautiful things I’ve ever seen.,YouTube
Thank yo for your beautiful work Allan. You capture Japan in a very special way and you narration is joyous,YouTube
"Absolutely the best video and information for those who are preparing trip to Japan. I loved the way the author talks, explains and shows the materials  Thank you",YouTube
The scenery with the good choice of music in the background makes this video probably the top travel videos I've seen in a while. Keep up the good work!,YouTube
Thanks for this video! I’m European so i’ll be going there for 4 weeks ,YouTube
"Thank you so much for this video! Very informative for my upcoming trip to Japan. Quick question which go-kart vendor did you go with and did you have to reserve in advance? Also, was it difficult getting an international permit for that?",YouTube
This itinerary sucks. Why tf would we wait 40 minutes for a coffee??,YouTube
Yikes not a well thought out plan. My wife and I did japan just before covid. We did more in 8 days. Based out of Kyoto tokyo. Your first mistake was not getting a JR rail pass.,YouTube
"Please work on ridding yourself of that irritating vocal fry.  If you don't know what it is, look it up.",YouTube
NEW SUB!! you guys explained this the best and im going with my mom and sister so we will be following this with lil touches of others. THANK YOU ,YouTube
Hi!! What was your daily budget during this trip??🫶🫶,YouTube
"Few things, I live in Tokyo.
Taxis aren't feasible in Tokyo, but in other cities, particularly in Kyoto, they are actually affordable. 

For internet, unless you are staying long-term a portable wi-fi hotspot is a better choice for your money rather than prepaid sim.
You did alright on accomodation, but I think capsule hotels are overrated, as they generally aren't all that competitively priced. Hostels are cheaper, albeit with fewer amenities.
Also careful throwing around recommendation to Yasakuni. Tourists are okay, but it's a highly politically controversial place here. Justin Bieber got some backlash for visiting recently. The emperor himself wouldn't be caught dead there.
Convenience store food is great and awesome, but the hot meals you selected aren't very cheap. You're better off finding a cheap ramen shop, which can be half the price and cheap.
 A good Fushimi Inari tip, if you want those good photos without the crowds, go before sunrise. I'm serious. Get up at 4 or 5, take a cab there, and the sun should be cresting as you near the top. 

Well put together I'd say, especially if this was your first time to Japan",YouTube
"I'm going to Tokyo JAPAN for the 1st time! I'm scared, nervous and excited all at the same time",YouTube
"I lived in Japan for 4 1/2 years, and I'm really surprised what a great, in-depth summary you've managed to put together for only two weeks there, including some things I didn't know - fantastic job!",YouTube
"I am crying. I miss Japan so very much. The magic of Japan lies not in the cities, but outside them. I went there in 2019 and fell in love with the place. How I wish I go further ahead in life and get settled here in some quaint little village, selling rice cakes and sake.. :')",YouTube
I finally went to japan for the first time & honestly it was so beautiful in real life ! I was there for a month for the cherry blossoms 🇯🇵,YouTube
"I honestly felt like i visited japan through this video , damn 
thanks a lot",YouTube

Keep up the awesome work and I can't wait to see more videos ️",YouTube
My mother took me to visit Tokyo & Kyoto 20 years ago. I adored it. My 11yr old really wants to visit Japan when Covid is in the rear-view mirror.  Your video is so beautiful and in depth. It shows everything I'd love to show my family about Japan. Thank you for making this!,YouTube

"I really love your channel and I shared it with my son who has been to Japan. His new wife and I will be joining him next summer in a visit to Japan. I kind of get overwhelmed by people and things and lights and noise but what I love most about your channel is how Zen you are, and you show all the beautiful features that make Japan Japan.

"Hello! Sorry for the sudden message, my name is Kim. I'm not good at anything except Japanese, so I use Google Translate. I'm sorry if you can't understand me. The reason I sent this message is because I had a question I wanted to ask you. My question is about videotaping and other services when traveling to Japan.
First, I would make a travel plan with a traveler coming to Japan in advance via message, meet him/her at the airport or other places, and accompany him/her for sightseeing with a camera. Then, I would like to start a business to videotape or photograph the trip and sell the edited video. Rates start at $333 per night and are negotiable if the trip is longer or takes longer to film. I am also available to assist you with your trip and answer any questions you may have while sightseeing. We will be using an earphone interpreter for interpretation. If so, do you find this service attractive? Would you use it or recommend it to family members? Do you think the fee is expensive? Thank you for reading to the end.",YouTube
"I have travel to in 2017 with my son for  the first time and was there for only one week. We did a lot in one week but not enough.
When this pandemic is under control I am planning to travel again to Japan. I love the country side and beauty of Nature. 
Off course I Love hiking so is my son. I Love your  video, very informative. Thank you ",YouTube

"Very Good !   My first vacation was back in 1989 to Japan.  When I had the opportunity I moved there in 2006 to 2008.   No matter how much I did, motorcycle ride, bar hop, hike, camp, and partied in Tokyo, rode trains,  I left feeling there was so much more to do.  So many things more to see..",YouTube

"I’m planning to visit Japan for my big 50th birthday in July. I have always wanted to go because of the beauty and culture of the place. However I’ve had mixed reactions from people that, it’s not the best time to go due to the hot/ humid weather.  But I think I would still enjoy it nonetheless. It seems very overwhelming and intimidating in planning the trip. However, I am so glad I have found this video, it provided me with great amazing ideas. Coming from Canada, where do I begin… would you recommend booking flight only or with hotels? Would you be to give a rough estimate on how much the cost you? Thank you so much for the wonderful video, getting me super excited",YouTube
Great videos! We are going to Kyoto and Osaka in July and your videos were very helpful! Question: what cell phone service did you have in Japan? We have AT&T here in the US and aren't sure what the best option is to still use our phones while there. Any insight would be appreciated! Thank you!,YouTube

"I’ve watched TONS of Japanese travel related videos. I’m a mom taking my son to Japan for his 18th birthday. A dream trip he’s wanted forever. . We have 7 days total (excluding arrival day). We arrive at 4pm so that’s why I’m counting it as half.

ANYWHO.. my plan is Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto and Mt. Fuji. So imagine my surprise when I found your video. Of course I am going to copy and paste all of this hahaha….minus the driving. You are brave to drive there (on the left) omg. 

Trains and taxis for me all the way. 


THANK YOU sooo much for this..restaurant recommendations etc. And I will check out your full Mt. Fuji video and Kyoto. The best. Im just a mom super hyped for my son but also super nervous. I even considered a guide but at $300 for just 6 hours, ..uhm,  no thank you! We will be fine. Thanks to awesome videos like this.

Happy travels!! 🫠",YouTube

"Ohayou　（おはよう） in AM; then Konichiwa,（こにち　は） (in stores they say Irashamasai) いらしまさい, after 5 konbanwa (こんばんは）。",YouTube
You can bring a larger luggage as long as it’s under 160cm in total dimensions on the train. To say that they are limited to carry on size only is misleading.,YouTube
"JR pass is now $500 for 7 days. Not worth at all.  To break even, it will require lots of speed running. But other than that, good guide",YouTube
"We’ve just come back from Japan, we should have waited until after this video  Also please can we take a moment to appreciate your hair?) ",YouTube
Love Japan! Thank you! BTW What are those animals on the furniture behind you? Where is the furniture piece from?,YouTube
"Konichiwa (こんにちは) = Good Day! Good Afternoon! Greetings during afternoon

"Konnichiwa is usually used from 10/11am til 5pm/dusk. Said with a bow, locals will return the greeting.",YouTube
Much better flying into Tokyo and out of Oosaka. My trip was no more expensive to do that....and it saves you money and time.,YouTube
"Oh, thanks! I have been really anxious trying to figure out how the JR Pass would work... Now I feel a bit better...",YouTube
"This is the best video on Japan I have seen! I don't usually watch videos longer than 10 minutes but yours sucked me in and I am so glad I watched it all to the end. It was very informative. I agree, this country has me more stressed trying to plan everything than anywhere else I have been lol.",YouTube
is there a way to get the suica app in english? I read that the english version app was removed and I don't see a way to download it in the app store,YouTube
"Wow even if the phone is off Suica functions!?! Amazing and the Food, love the UmamiAmazing, wanned to vomit my brain out ️",YouTube

Any tips on wifi and eSIM cards?  TY!,YouTube
I read many locals do not like the go carts running since they’re loud. Many find it annoying. I would discourage tourists from doing this. ,YouTube
"Hi!  Totally hear you about travelling just with hand baggage rather than a checked in bag. Usually I only travel with handluggage even for trips that are a few weeks. However, I am hoping to stop at Japan on my way home from a 6 month secondment abroad and will thus have both a checked case and a cabin one (so 2 suitcases). Do you think this would make thngs very difficult re travelling around? In your experience do hostels/hotels have luggage storage e.g. if i was to leave the big case there for a few days whilst visiting another place?
Many thanks in advance!",YouTube
"If you want to stay at a hot spring inn, please search by copying ``温泉'' and ``宿''　Thank you for introducing your trip to Japan in detail.",YouTube
Do you need reservations for the go-carts?,YouTube

Thank you for your reproduction.",YouTube
Is there a preference for Shibuya Sky over Skytree or Tokyo Tower?  There is not enough time to see more than one.,YouTube
Check out the new changes to the Jr. pass.It's gone up in price and some people are starting to say it's not worth it.,YouTube
"Japan is about the culture and everything unfolds from there. Harmony and not bothering others in the public space (trains for example) is a prominent cultural value. Don't stand two abreast on escalators, don't stop in the middle of a flow of people to look for something, tune into to the locals around you as an indicator. Carry a small plastic bag for your trash and dispose of it at your hotel as there are almost no public trash cans, yet the country is very clean. Don't litter. Respect in Kyoto the closure of some private streets to tourists and don't stalk the geishas for pictures. There may be a public performance you can see them in, check at your hotel. Remember shrines and temples are still active religious sites. Your trip will be smoother and feel more rewarding.",YouTube
"trains never ever sale out, there are plenty of other trains , which go in 2-3 min",YouTube
"Interesting that you know Spanish.  English was obviously the lingua franca, but I heard native speaking of Spanish about as much as English.  I think it’s because the peso is almost 3 times as strong against the yen as a few years ago.",YouTube

"I've flown to Japan many times as I'm Japanese/American. Flying business class, which is what the video show'd is around $10,000 + per person. Not feasible for the standard traveler.",YouTube

"Hi, I liked your video. Please share the $$ you spend on the 10day tour excluding Air ticket to Japan.",YouTube
So how much would you say this whole trip cost? What should I expect to spend for a 10 day trip for 2 adults?,YouTube
"In Tokyo stay near Ueno, there's tons of cheap hotels around there. Also for the train ride get any sandwich with egg from Lawson or 7-11, I think they cost about $1 and the Japanese make the best egg sandwiches on the planet",YouTube

"Ah, Japan! 🇯🇵 That's a fascinating country known for its rich culture, beautiful landscapes, and delicious cuisine. From the bustling city streets of Tokyo to the serene temples of Kyoto, Japan offers a unique blend of traditional and modern experiences. If you're interested in visiting Japan, there are so many incredible things to explore, like the cherry blossoms in spring, the historic castles, and the vibrant street markets. Let me know if you need any specific recommendations or have any questions about Japan, King! ",YouTube
"Even as time goes by and the surface of a town changes, nothing changes in the underlying foundation of the unique Japanese culture.
The common root of the creation of originality in Japanese culture is the uniqueness of its geopolitical location and the influence of its natural environment.
Even if they import culture and knowledge from abroad, they are not dominated by it, and after a certain period of time, they select the content, integrate it with their own culture, improve it, and eventually create a new style because of the influence of their unique natural environment.

Japan's original country name ""NIPPON”(Japan) means ""the land under the sun"" , but another name is ""YAMATO(WA)” , meaning “Peacefully Harmony among People and Nature”.　
So Japan's name means “the Land under the Sun” and” the Land of ""Great Harmony of People and Nature,”
The history of Japan is very old, about 2,000 years since the Emperor's reign, but humans began to live in villages and communities in this island nation about 14,000 years ago, during “the JOMON pottery” culture.
(That's 30,000 years ago, if you count the Neolithic period.)

Surrounded on all sides by the sea and geographically isolated from the Eurasian continent in the Pacific Ocean, this island nation has a warm and humid climate and is blessed with abundant underground clear water resources, diverse vegetation, and fishery resources.
For this reason, people have lived here for tens of thousands of years, enjoying nature and living in peace with it.
However, while the natural environment of this island nation is rich, it is also harsh, with both light and dark sides.
Since ancient times, the people of this land have lived in peace by respecting human harmony and working together as a group, and have shared and enjoyed the blessings of nature by overcoming many harsh and severe natural disasters such as volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, and typhoons by sharing wisdom and working together as a group.
This is because this island nation has a harsh natural environment that cannot be overcome by the power of one individual.

The ancient Japanese name of the country, ""YAMATO"" or ""WA"" (Peacefully Harmony among People and Nature)　represents the desire and reality of people trying to survive in the unique natural environment of an island nation, which is different from the dry and stable land of the Eurasian continent.
And it is in this ancient Japanese country name that the essence of Japanese culture and the source and secret of the emergence of a unique Japanese culture different from the cultures of other Asian countries on the continent are hidden.",YouTube

- 예슈아커밍 / Yeshua Coming -

November 07 2023 7:30 am~8:00 am (30 minutes)

Dream!!

It was a very vivid dream about the rapture.

The scene was set like this.

It's home. I'm doing something in the kitchen on the first floor. When I looked to the east, I could see the window facing the outside very clearly, and when I looked, I saw a seal slowly approaching the house. And on the right side, there was a white bird like a seagull.

It's so strange. What kind of beach animals came here? I guess that they must be hungry. I have to give something to them. It was like this. When I looked outside, it seemed like it had rained a lot and the ground was very wet.

And when I looked to the south, I saw a field and there was a lot of water, probably because it had rained a lot. I hope that the rain will stop. I'm sure the water won't get inside the house. I was thinking like this. The water came in very quickly.

It's only been a short time, but the water has already reached right in front of the house. Seals and seagulls are splashing around. What is this? The water is just rushing in. It is clear water.

I was looking at south, I see two boats pushing almost in front of my house. It seems like a tsunami. I was think like that It shouldn't come inside the house, but before I could even think about it, the water had already very suddenly risen to my chest.

What should I take care of in this very urgent situation? I'm out of my mind. There is no time to think about what to put in the bag. I thought I should just get out, so I just got out.

In the meantime, I can't feel gravity. My body was going up. I guess it's the rapture. It's a very amazing and strange feeling. I can't feel gravity in my body. It has nothing to do with my will.

The rapture is now. I was looking down, I see that there are still people left. So I shouted loudly that I was going up now. I said, “I’m going now” and “I’ll see you from up there.” When I see it from the air, there are people going up as well, but there are also many people who remain on the ground.

In the air, I encountered a man sitting on a very tall building. I made eye contact with the man and said this. Do you know about the rapture? Now this is the rapture. The rapture is now. God wants more people to be raptured. We need to tell people about the rapture. I looked there and opened my eyes.

I waked up by the alarm and opened my eyes, and it was a very vivid dream, a dream about the rapture, a dream like a vivid drama, but 30 minutes had passed on this earth.

This is a vision. The rapture is very soon. We need to tell people about the rapture.",YouTube

I also want to thank the USA, Holland, UK, Sweden, Denmark and many other great countries that helped us, the lost boys of Sudan. They say we are lost but you are never lost until you're dead..

"I really enjoyed this video, and it brought back so many good memories of my days living in Japan from 2002 to 2003.  Thank you!",YouTube
So glad to have found this y’all literally hit EVERY stop we want to go to on our first trip to Japan ,YouTube
I just came back from Japan. And feeling like homesick since I want to be back. So this is very comforting. Thank you,YouTube
One of the best Japan Vlog I have seen so far. TREMENDOUSLY MAGISTICAL,YouTube
Love your humour! May both of you be happy together for a long life!,YouTube
True. I've never tired of looking at sakura when i travelled  japan. And i'm still want to go back again and again.,YouTube
"I want to do everything in this video with the exception of the plane ride, jet-lag, back-pain and hospital part. Considering that mere pictures of Mount Fuji emanate a powerful ""energy"", I can only imagine what it's like in person. I've been to Niagara Falls so I imagine it would feel similar. I wish that I could afford to go to Japan someday. My dream would be to go on a tourist trip around Japan, South Korea, China, and Mongolia. Until then, I guess I will have to enjoy it vicariously through videos like this. Thanks for this amazing video! I appreciate that you took the time during your trip to make this video so that we can enjoy a little bit of Japan right here at home.",YouTube
This is how you do a proper travel video. Good mix of info and personality.,YouTube
"Oh wow...really amaizing...n peacefull...
I am going to add this to my future travell wishlist..!
I never knew Japan was these butifulln calming...",YouTube
I will be back in Japan in no time.  I still have lots to see. Love Japan,YouTube
"I am so glad that I found your Vlog. I have wanted to visit Japan for decades, and haven’t made it yet. Your tour was so informative and enjoyable. It was a great overview of so many wonderful experiences. I even feel more informed about the famous toilets!",YouTube
"Thank u so much for realizing this video, ur peaceful voice makes it so enjoyable to watch it and my love for Japan which was already big now it's even bigger,  U deserve more subscribers!!",YouTube
"Japan has the best medical system I've ever seen in the world! I had a bike accident on the streets of Osaka. I got messed up. I walked 3 miles to the hospital and immediately before they even took my name 8 people came out and took me into a room. Operated on my face, fixed me up gave me some pain medicine and some antibiotics too so it didn't get worse. 


It cost $97. That included a second visit where they took out my stitches. A week later my kaisha hoken (company insurance) kicked and I got a rebate for the full $97.  I have never been so taken care of anywhere in the world for $97 in my life. Japan doesn't do all things right. But health 100% is one of them!",YouTube
I like how you put things into a comedy-sarcasm and a very informative video at the same time lol,YouTube
"Thank you for sharing this, you and your wife are quite enjoyable to watch, your light humor is lovely. You’re editing  is phenomenal .Thank you thank you keep up the good work",YouTube
"This is probably the best Vlog of a holiday I've seen and since I prepare for my own holiday, I've seen quite a lot. This is just so infomative and entertaining at the same time, I highly recommend anyone to watch this if you wanna get an inside look at what a holiday in Japan can be like. Definitely worth the time!",YouTube
Glad i have found this channel. A fair amount of very well-made videos. Absolutely deserves more subscribers! Please keep up the good work!,YouTube
"You certainly smashed a lot in over your 2 weeks. I think you touched on everything - the fun, the ridiculous, the culture, the history, the food, the beauty. Mt Fuji was my favourite part, looks a place you don't just see, but you can feel.",YouTube
"I was visited Japan in 2008 and I am planning to go back soon.  I love the food, the sceneries and the people.  Thanks!!!",YouTube
"Poetry in motion - Japan in all its shades and colours .Japan is one of those countries which have managed to hold on to its culture and tradition even while taking great strides in sci and tech . You've done a great job in capturing it's quintessence in people , food , nature and the environment . Living in Japan is truly an art , being a part of the whole .What a splendid experience .Thanks for the trip . I couldn't help noticing your delight in being with your friends in Halone .",YouTube

"Kinkakuji is beautiful, there is also a silver temple, Ginkakuji.  Arashiyama is awesome...I almost ended up in the hospital though whenI tried to go up the mountain, I fell down the side of the mountain and the only thing that saved me was holding onto a small tree that stopped my fall off the cliffside onto the sidewalk down below.    At night people wil lburn fires in barrels to stay warm.   Arashiyama also has a cool bamboo forest..it was a  favorite haunt of mine back when I lived in Osaka.   Lol Nara deer will headbut you if you don't feed them....also go see Todaiji..it is incredible.",YouTube
"Amazing tour, I am going to japan in May but already have a hotel for the 10 days I'm staying there. Will try to use the Jr pass to get as many cities as I can",YouTube

You guys need to be given an Oscar award for best travel vlog never have I been so captured by a travel vlog where everything from filming to narrating really puts me as if I’m back in Japan. Your Vlog was so good that I was near tears by the end of it the same way I felt when I left. If you can do that to a viewer then you have great skills. ,YouTube
Perfect fun for armchair travelers—and definitely inspiring a visit to Japan!,YouTube

What a fabulous video! I felt like I was watching a fun BBC programme. I enjoyed it so much and learned a great deal. I've already recommended it to a friend who is heading to Japan in March 2018. I am sure he will find it helpful.,YouTube
Always love the concierge service in Japan of sending the luggage before check in. Seems to be the only country doing that. Brilliant.,YouTube
"just got back from a holiday trip in Japan, lovely country like who will not love Japan? it was awesome experience . i would love to go back again .",YouTube
"top video! im going to visit japan in December it helpt me a lot with the places i wanted to go. i couldn't decide where to go or visit in only 14 days. so it helpt me a bit, thanks.",YouTube

Hopefully, the world will return to some semblance of normalcy and we can return to see the snow monkeys. Now I want a sashimi dinner. Would love to hear more of Chiaki’s insights. Safe travels!!",YouTube
"I just visited japan 3 weeks ago and it was one of the best trips of my life. Not only does your video capture the details of the locations, but the essence and ethos of it. Your commentary is well versed, informative, and doesn't feel over the top like so many other vlogs. Even though its been just three weeks, this video made me want to go back there again. You have earned my subscription.",YouTube
"Wow that was one of the best travel vlogs about Japan I seen on Youtube.:)
Very nice.",YouTube

With all of the excitement your voice was very soothing and your wife is adorable.

The only thing Id look into doing different is find a nice retreat to make me feel more stable and NOT need to drag my luggage around town.

THANKS FOR SHARING",YouTube

"iPhone video quality is amazing and I can't believe how far phone tech has come for you to film this vlog. I will be filming my own vids for personal use when I go Japan for my own leisurely viewing. 
Your content, editing and production is incredible. First vlog of yours I have watched. I will be going for 14 days but it seems like 2 weeks is not enough! All the aspects you mentioned at the end of the video confirms that I will enjoy Japan very much...",YouTube
"As a jaded gaijin having been born and lived in Japan for 30 years on and off, this video is brilliant as it is very well edited and shows a well planned visit to the tourist spots. The food shots made me drool...I look forward to my  next visit. Thank you Space Monkey!",YouTube

"Amazing quality, I loved this movie! A thousand standing ovations bravo! ",YouTube
This is probably the best travel vlog I've seen so far.   Very well done.  I'm looking forward to seeing more of your posts in Japan.  I like how you touch on the details very quickly and that they aren't drawn out.   Bravo!,YouTube
"You are a cute couple
..and you take great videos with a lot of attention to the details...very good.  Really enjoyed the experience through your experience.",YouTube
"What a wonderful narration, now I want to go even more!",YouTube
Thank you your video is a great help for someone like me that’s hoping to go to Japan next year,YouTube
I was in the Osaka/Nara area for about a year. But that was in the late 89s. I strive to go again before I die.,YouTube
This is the video I needed. Going in October for 12 days. Thanks for the great video!,YouTube
"Best Jaban tour guide ever , i will use it in planning my tour. Thank you",YouTube
"Thanks a lot. Very well documented. I am planning to go to Japan for 14 days. Sticking to Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka as this is my first time. I was hoping to find some side trips from these cities and plan out the route. This video really helps and I could add few more places to consider into the list of places I want to visit.",YouTube
I've been to most of the sights mentioned in the video but still learned and found inspirations for more. This video is great for first timers and experienced visitors!,YouTube
"This vid is amazing, very inspiring. Thanks for that!",YouTube
"Thanks for the knowledge and inspiration,  would love to visit Japan",YouTube
How can this video only have 2k likes? This is the best travel itinerary we’ve ever seen!!!,YouTube
"Josh! Well done lad, you put it all together and laid it out so wonderfully. How does the JNTO not utilize you as an ambassador?!  Wishing you many views and likes for this beauty!",YouTube
"Thank you so much for posting this video, this has been one of the better 2 week video I've seen. I'm going in Feb for just over 10 days and thankfully I cannot sleep in later than 5a so I can't wait to see the Fushi Inari and Bamboo forest early as well as the Plum Blossoms, a little sad you didn't mention them in your video as I'm having trouble figuring out the best spot to see them T_T",YouTube
Thanks man so difficult to wrap my head around your info...keep it up,YouTube
"such an informative, well made video! thank you for this quality content",YouTube
"Thank you for this video, it really give me a good insight of travelling to Japan without going thru a tour agency.  
Do you think it’s a good idea to drive in certain place that you recommended like Kyoto?",YouTube
This has to be the best content out there :) Thanks,YouTube
This is really the best guide to Japan!,YouTube
"Good news! Apparently, Japan will be opening its borders to individual tourists starting October 11! I just posted on my channel our travel to Sapporo last 2020, a month before all the pandemic restrictions were imposed cause I really missed the country. Hopefully, if everything goes well, looking forward to our trip to Osaka this coming November",YouTube
"I did shorter, but similar trip in 2019. Tokyo(3d)-Nara(0.5d)-Kyoto(2.5d)-Hiroshima(0.5d)-Himeji(0.5d)-Tokyo in one week. It was great albeit pretty tight, but I was agile enough as I travelled solo. And of course you need a most detailed itinerary worked out in advance. I’d say Tokyo-Hiroshima route is the easiest choice for your first 1-2 week long trip, cos there are so many places to visit. If Japan ever opens again, I am going for 2 weeks at the very least.",YouTube
Thank you for a great overview.. I'm excited ,YouTube
Absolutely Amazing Video Sir!!!,YouTube
"Three yrs ago I spent 6 weeks traveling from Kumamoto in Kyushu to Sapporo, Hokkaido.  It was obviously the trip of a lifetime, but I saved for it, & went first class the entire way.  Had a Shinkansen pass, & just went wherever I felt like going, and I loved it.  Hokkaido in December/January is my favorite place in the world.",YouTube
"going to Japan in May 2023 and I'm looking forward to the views, food and a different culture that I havnt experienced in my life ^_^",YouTube
"Great video, thank you for your hard work and diligence in compiling this guide!",YouTube
映像がとても綺麗で感動しました！,YouTube
"this was so helpful, I am planning to go to Japan early September all on my own (First time travelling alone as well) and this video gave me a lot more confidence to plan out a good schedule of things I would love to do and visit. Very good recommendations and showed pretty much the cool hotspots I also would like to go to! I'm going to planning this out now and probably look for more tips to make this trip as amazing as possible. I'm finally making my dream come true! :D",YouTube
Thank you so much this video is very well made and it helped me a lot. I will definitely visit Japan!,YouTube
"Thank you for this inspiring video. I will actually follow this exact itinerary in two weeks time, looking forward!",YouTube
"Such a beautiful view.

Thank you for your video.
It’s always relaxing to watch.",YouTube
I spent 2 years in Japan and this video has brought out the urge to return once more. A nice short side trip is visiting the Kintai Bashi in Iwakuni.,YouTube
"I'm going for the first time in November and this had me in tears. It has also shown me a lot that I think I  was going to miss, I need to re-watch and write it down. Thanks ",YouTube
"Thanks for the video I want to go to Japan in February next year for two weeks so I wanted to have a look at your Itinerary. I also quite liked when you mentioned the different seasons to go. I have not looked at your channel yet, but I will do that now, and a video about seasonal highlights would be great. :)",YouTube
Extremely concise but very informative coverage of travel in Japan.,YouTube
"I hope to visit not just Tokyo, but the country side of Japan and during the raining season! It looks soo calming and would be good for my PTSD!",YouTube
Keep going! Your videos are high quality,YouTube
"Best Japan Explanation video, great job Inaka, I'm going next month so exited !!!",YouTube
"Great info, to the point, nice shooting. Thanks for posting this, one of the best Japan travel vids I’ve found.",YouTube
Great 2 week itinerary! I will be traveling to Japan this november and already got my JR Rail Pass. I plan to spend most my time in Tokyo but visit Kyoto and Osaka for a few days. I will most definitely be using the suggestions in your video when i'm in those cities.,YouTube
Well done u guys really pushed life a good eg for the rest ,YouTube
"Wow this was great, So much information. My first trip to Japan was nearly 12 days and kinda similar (just much more simplified haha).... 5 nights in Tokyo 2 in Kyoto and rest in Osaka...  While in Tokyo, I did visit Matsushima Bay (took a boat trip too :D), Asakusa,  Sky Tree, Meiji Temple, Emperor's Castle (need to book months in advance, can't go inside the building, but worth it), Akihabara, Ginza etc... In Kyoto (Fushi Inari),  some temples. While in Osaka, I went to Hajieme Jo and Nara. The best trip of my life haha",YouTube
Great video! The Tomogashima islands look like a really interesting place to explore. So cool that this was an inspiration for Castle in the Sky! Thanks for sharing.,YouTube
This video literally had me speechless the entire time. It’s so beautiful,YouTube
"My god, this video is absolutely amazing! Can’t wait to visit Japan in May this year.",YouTube
leaving for a 2 week trip to japan feb4 defiantly adding a bunch of this to my list!! thanks!,YouTube
"I did this itinerary, like 90% of what he said to do. If I was to do it again I’d do it across 3 weeks and spend a couple extra nights in certain places (mt Fuji, Gujo hachiman and Kyoto) and also do extensive research on each spot to see whether I would like it or not. I did enjoy it all but there are some things I could’ve skipped and spent going to other places in Japan that weren’t on the list. All in all a good reference. Japan is beautiful",YouTube
"While Tochigi prefecture might not be the first name that comes to mind when thinking of Japan, it's actually a great place to live! Nikko is undeniably famous for its breathtaking shrines and temples, but Nasu, where I call home, offers a different kind of charm. Known for its stunning natural beauty, relaxing hot springs, and charming villages, it also boasts the Imperial residence. As a former golf enthusiast, I can't forget to mention that Nasu is also one of the most affordable places to golf in Japan, which definitely added to its appeal for me.",YouTube
"Nicely done and with great narration,  warranted multiple viewings. Thank you for an informative, engaging and entertaining video.",YouTube
Starting to plan my trip. I feel so emotional and excited to go. I will update my comment when it happens! Cheers,YouTube
It was nice to see content that doesn't show the same things most videos do. Thank you,YouTube
it was complete itinerary anyone could ask for ,YouTube
"We will be heading to Tokyo in October 2023!
My wife's 50th birthday present,that she doesn't know of yet..
We have been talking bout going there since 2021
For my 50th birthday in November 2022,I took my family to Seoul,South Korea & we had an incredible time (3 weeks) over there
Your video just solidified my desire to take my family to Japan this year...amazing scenery!
I can't wait
Kamsahamnida for your wonderful & insightful upload!
Much alofas from New Zealand",YouTube
I enjoyed travelling with you and your wife. Thank you.,YouTube
Such a wonderfully edited video absolutely stunning you have helped me add stuff to my trip to Japan thank you for such a wonderful video,YouTube
Fantastic video! I really enjoyed your voice too. The only thing I would like to add is that you can organise pocket WiFi before you arrive in Japan. Some companies organise for you to pick it up from your hotel when you arrive. They provide a self stamped envelope so you can just return it via post when you leave Japan.,YouTube
Is such an amazing place to visit it was my first trip outside Europe and is worth the hype! We spent almost a month and was fab ,YouTube
your photography is world class,YouTube
Its crazy how much your recommendation matches our itinerary for next week. Ill see if our group is interested in exploring any of the areas you had that we missed.,YouTube
Thank you for this video. I appreciate the time and effort that went into making this! Will draw on this for my own trip in a few weeks!,YouTube
Love your videos! So informative~ Keep it up!!,YouTube
"wow thanks for making this, it is super helpful!",YouTube
Great video!  Very well put together and a lot of good information.,YouTube
"I absolutely loved this!!!!! 
I’m not very good with travel and a day by day step by step of where to stay and how many nights ect would be soooo handy. Like how long to stay in hotels and where. Don’t need hotel recommendations but this would be so handy. 
Again amazing video will deffo use this for my trip in January.",YouTube
"Great video, super helpful. Thank you!",YouTube
"Excellent videography and comprehensive round-it-all information for a tour through the Land of Rising Sun.

Yet, it might only be me to feel the narrative a bit in an effort to cramp as much and as fast as possible through the clip.",YouTube
great video! thank you for all of the information,YouTube
I had no problem watching this great video.Im going to Japan in Oct as my workmates daring me to travel solo .Don't know what to expect but your video comes handy .Greetings fr Aus 🇦🇺,YouTube
I wouldn't want to leave. ,YouTube
Great video. Very informative and helpful,YouTube
"Thank you so much, the video was beautiful and helped me a lot. Will update this comment after my trip.",YouTube
"The best time to climb the Fushi Inari in Kyoto is early in the morning or right before the sunset.  It is amazing!  Barely crowded, and I do that every evening as an exercise when I stay in Kyoto!

JAPAN = HEAVEN ON EARTH!!!",YouTube
This is one of the best Japan Trip video i've ever seen  :),YouTube
amazing job! can't wait to go soon.,YouTube
Im going in November I’m so excited!,YouTube
So excited to use this to plan our trip! Do you have a video or a list of recommended places to stay in these areas? That would be so helpful!!,YouTube
Thanks for the video! I enjoyed it very much!,YouTube
Thank you so much for your advance. I'm going to Japan tomorrow. Will follow your advance.,YouTube
"you make real nice japan videos 
both of us and our mum and dad love them all 
rachel and christina",YouTube
Super helpful traveling to Japan for my first time in a couple weeks.  Thank you,YouTube
Nice video.  My son is going to Japan in April.  He watched your video to learn more about places to go in Japan.,YouTube
"Left Tokyo in the afternoon and climbed Fuji, catched the sunrise, ran down, headed off to the monkey onsen in Nagano and got back to work the next day. Best way to spend a weekend.",YouTube
Which city in Japan do you want to visit most?,YouTube
"Japan have got various enjoy place if you want something, welcome to Japan ️",YouTube
"thank you for this video, this is the best video about japan ever . really helpful thank you",YouTube
Such a wonderful compilation! Thank you so much,YouTube
"I went to Japan in 2019 (just before COVID, so im grateful i managed to do it) but this is a well thought out trip. Probably need to squeeze in there a couple of rest days, but otherwise, i kind of done sort of the same tour, but starting from Nagoya. What would be really awesome is a mapped out trip but going north from Tokyo all the way to sapporo in hokaido.",YouTube
"Wow I think this is one the best Itinerary videos I've watched! Btw do you think Feb-March are good months to travel to Japan, I'm planning on going around those dates... if they ever allow tourism again haha",YouTube
Definitely taking notes for our upcoming trip! Thank you for sharing! ,YouTube
Very well done! great shots,YouTube
"Amazing guide, although all that in 2 weeks is only if your young. I need 2-3 day stays at each location, not a fan of the gogogo. Rather stop to smell the roses. Do you have patreon? Would love to contribute for more videos like these. But would like to do this itinerary in a month long stay when it opens back up to tourists in 2030.",YouTube
"i m really waiting for the borders to open for individuals to open and thanks a lot for such an informative video.
if anyone wishes we can travel japan together as i m travelling solo and it would be lovely if i make new friends and make lifetime unexpcted memories.",YouTube
"So me and a buddy are planning to travel to japan sometime around October this year. He is returning from the navy and is fully vaccinated meanwhile I have never received a single shot and am not vaccinated. Obviously you cannot predict the future with how the pandemic will sway, but in your opinion will we be permitted to go by that point in time? Keep in mind we haven’t committed to any set plans yet, (havent purchased any tickets, made any arrangements). Also, we would rather not pay for a tourism package and would like to free roam the country ourselves for most likely two weeks, anything that comes to budgeting whether that be living accommodations, food etc would be planned much prior from day of departure.",YouTube
The fact that you managed to post this video was my only thing calming me down while you were hiking on your own in the dark,YouTube
"In my honest opinion, Japan is THE most beautiful place in the entire universe! So clean, organized, and so friendly with endless array of natures and super-urban elements all around!  Japan Forever!",YouTube
"Hmmmm good video. Thorough insight, well done. This is a nice playlist to work your way through. However considering the different styles and themes of each of the areas in Japan it would be better, in my opinion, if the different sections of the video reflected their respective sections of the trip both in an auditory and visual capacity. This way views could both easily identify and associate each video section with the specific point in their trip and get a feel for the for the area of Japan they would be visiting on any given day, as opposed to simply being told. I am in no way saying you should film the trip yourself and realise it would be a hassle to make a video with my suggestions. This is just opinion. Hope you appreciate the insight.",YouTube
Great video! Lots of amazing information and beautiful shots and editing.,YouTube
Incredible video! Im in the mids of planning a trip to Japan and this video has given me some really good inspiration on what to do!,YouTube
"Thank you so mucht for amerzing vdo with all infomations. I am planing to visit Japan on March 2022 by myself , excited !!",YouTube

This is some absolutely incredible content! Thank you!,YouTube
Very nicely made video. We would be re-visiting Japan in April 2023 to celebrate 25th birthday of my son; he was born there....I started looking at various info and I found this video to be the best so far....will watch again with family. Thanks for uploading....,YouTube
"This is a really great and helpful travel report, thanks a lot!",YouTube
